# Psykip

We compiled translations from different authors at different points of history alongside the original Enchiridion to make sure you can read your favorite version of it.

## Why?
The Enchiridion is a fascinating book, an easy read filled with valuable insights. Unfortunately—even with multiple public domain translations—reading it can often be a bad experience. 

Between old and sometimes confusing terms, hard to find and even harder to download files, and outdated websites, the barriers between an interested reader and this content are monumental. So, why not make a website that solves these problems?

## How?
1. We focused our efforts on design. While the content is the reason we built this site, its presentation is what solves the problems listed above. We made the best way to read the Enchiridion with our user experience and interface.
1. Even though some translations aren't the best for everyone, they might be the favorites of some folks, so instead of pushing for one or another, we made it easy to read the one that works for YOU.
1. We understand that books are hard to share, and with multiple file types that work for different devices with different applications, a project like this can grow out of control fast. That's why we took a step back and decided to serve the content from each translation in a way that's easy to read and share; nothing more, nothing less.

We took eight markdown files from [Tasuki's](https://enchiridion.tasuki.org/) website, then updated their metadata and divided them into 424 files for the individual chapters. Our versions of the files are available on [Github](https://github.com/bdsqqq/psykip/tree/master/src/data)
