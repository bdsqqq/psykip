You can be unconquerable, if you enter into no combat in which it is not in
your own power to conquer. When, therefore, you see any one eminent in honors
or power, or in high esteem on any other account, take heed not to be
bewildered by appearances and to pronounce him happy; for if the essence of
good consists in things within our own power, there will be no room for envy or
emulation. But, for your part, do not desire to be a general, or a senator, or
a consul, but to be free; and the only way to this is a disregard of things
which lie not within our own power.
