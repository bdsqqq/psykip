##  49

When any one shows himself vain, on being able to understand and interpret the
works of Chrysippus, say to yourself: "Unless Chrysippus had written obscurely,
this person would have had nothing to be vain of. But what do I desire? To
understand Nature, and follow her. I ask, then, who interprets her; and hearing
that Chrysippus does, I have recourse to him. I do not understand his writings.
I seek, therefore, one to interpret *them*." So far there is nothing to value
myself upon. And when I find an interpreter, what remains is to make use of his
instructions. This alone is the valuable thing. But if I admire merely the
interpretation, what do I become more than a grammarian, instead of a
philosopher, except, indeed, that instead of Homer I interpret Chrysippus? When
any one, therefore, desires me to read Chrysippus to him, I rather blush, when
I cannot exhibit actions that are harmonious and consonant with his discourse.
