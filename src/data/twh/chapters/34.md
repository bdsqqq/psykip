If you are dazzled by the semblance of any promised pleasure, guard yourself
against being bewildered by it; but let the affair wait your leisure, and
procure yourself some delay. Then bring to your mind both points of time, -that
in which you shall enjoy the pleasure, and that in which you will repent and
reproach yourself, after you have enjoyed it, - and set before you, in
opposition to these, how you will rejoice and applaud yourself, if you abstain.
And even though it should appear to you a seasonable gratification, take heed
that its enticements and allurements and seductions may not subdue you; but set
in opposition to this, how much better it is to be conscious of having gained
so great a victory.
