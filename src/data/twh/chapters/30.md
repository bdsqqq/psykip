##  30

Duties are universally measured by relations. Is a certain man your father? In
this are implied, taking care of him; submitting to him in all things;
patiently receiving his reproaches, his- correction. But he is a bad father. Is
your natural tie, then, to a *good* father? No, but to a father. Is a brother
unjust? Well, preserve your own just relation towards him. Consider not what
*he* does, but what *you* are to do, to keep your own will in a state
conformable to nature. For another cannot hurt you, unless you please. You will
then be hurt when you consent to be hurt. In this manner, therefore, if you
accustom yourself to contemplate the relations of neighbor, citizen, commander,
you can deduce from each the corresponding duties.
