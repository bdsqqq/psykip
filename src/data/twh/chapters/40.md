##  40

Women from fourteen years old are flattered by men with the title of
mistresses. Therefore, perceiving that they are regarded only as qualified to
give men pleasure, they begin to adorn themselves, and in that to place all
their hopes. It is worth while, therefore, to try that they may perceive
themselves honored only so far as they appear beautiful in their demeanor, and
modestly virtuous.
