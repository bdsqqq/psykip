The body is to every one the proper measure of its possessions, as the foot is
of the shoe. If, therefore, you stop at this, you will keep the measure; but if
you move beyond it, you must necessarily be carried forward, as down a
precipice; as in the case of a shoe, if you go beyond its fitness to the foot,
it comes first to be gilded, then purple, and then studded with jewels.  For to
that which once exceeds the fit measure there is no bound.
