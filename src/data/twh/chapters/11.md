Never say of anything, "I have lost it;" but, " I have restored it." Has your
child died? It is restored. Has your wife died? She is restored. Has your
estate been taken away? That likewise is restored. " But it was a bad man who
took it."  What is it to you by whose hands he who gave it has demanded it
again? While he permits you to possess it, hold it as something not your own;
as do travellers at an inn.
