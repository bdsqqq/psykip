##  45

Does any one bathe hastily? Do not say that he does it ill, but hastily. Does
any one drink much wine? Do not say that he does ill, but that he drinks a
great deal. For unless you perfectly understand his motives, how should you
know if he acts ill? Thus you will not risk yielding to any appearances but
such as you fully comprehend.
