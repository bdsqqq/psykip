##  46

Never proclaim yourself a philosopher; nor make much talk among the ignorant
about your principles, but show them by actions. Thus, at an entertainment, do
not discourse how people ought to eat; but eat as you ought. For remember that
thus Socrates also universally avoided all ostentation. And when persons came
to him, and desired to be introduced by him to philosophers, he took them and
introduced them; so well did he bear being overlooked. So if ever there should
be among the ignorant any discussion of principles, be for the most part
silent. For there is great danger in hastily throwing out what is undigested.
And if any one tells you that you know nothing, and you are not nettled at it,
then you may be sure that you have really entered on your work.  For sheep do
not hastily throw up the grass, to show the shepherds how much they have eaten;
but, inwardly digesting their food, they produce it outwardly in wool and milk.
Thus, therefore, do you not make an exhibition before the ignorant of your
principles; but of the actions to which their digestion gives rise.
