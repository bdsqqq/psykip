##  4

When you set about any action, remind yourself of what nature the action is. If
you are going to bathe, represent to yourself the incidents usual in the bath, -
some persons pouring out, others pushing in, others scolding, others pilfering.
And thus you will more safely go about this action, if you say to yourself, " I
will now go to bathe, and keep my own will in harmony with nature." And so with
regard to every other action. For thus, if any impediment arises in bathing,
you will be able to say, "It was not only to bathe that I desired, but to keep
my will in harmony with nature; and I shall not keep it thus, if I am out of
humor at things that happen."
