As the proposition, *either it is day, or it is night*, has much force in a
disjunctive argument, but none at all in a conjunctive one; so, at a feast, to
choose the largest share is very suitable to the bodily appetite, but utterly
inconsistent with the social spirit of the entertainment. Remember, then, when
you eat with another, not only the value to the body of those things which are
set before you, but also the value of proper courtesy towards your host.
