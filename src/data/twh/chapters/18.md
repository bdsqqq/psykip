##  18

When a raven happens to croak unluckily, be not overcome by appearances, but
discriminate, and say, " Nothing is portended to *me*; but either to my paltry
body, or property, or reputation, or children, or wife. But to *me* all
portents are lucky, if I will.  For whatsoever happens, it belongs to me to
derive advantage therefrom."
