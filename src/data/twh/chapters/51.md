##  51

How long, then, will you delay to demand of yourself the noblest improvements,
and in no instance to transgress the judgments of reason? You have received the
philosophic principles with which you ought to be conversant; and you have been
conversant with them.  For what other master, then, do you wait as an excuse
for this delay in self-reformation? You are no longer a boy, but a grown man.
If, therefore, you will be negligent and slothful, and always add
procrastination to procrastination, purpose to purpose, and fix day after day
in which you will attend to yourself, you will insensibly continue to
accomplish nothing, and, living and dying, remain of vulgar mind. This instant,
then, think yourself worthy of living as a man grown up and a proficient. Let
whatever appears to be the best, be to you an inviolable law. And if any
instance of pain or pleasure, glory or disgrace, be set before you, remember
that now is the combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put off; and
that by one failure and defeat honor may be lost - or won. Thus Socrates became
perfect, improving himself by everything, following reason alone.  And though
you are not yet a Socrates, you ought, however, to live as one seeking to be a
Socrates.
