##  15

Remember that you must behave as at a banquet.  Is anything brought round to
you? Put out your hand, and take a moderate share. Does it pass by you?  Do not
stop it. Is it not yet come? Do not yearn in desire towards it, but wait till
it reaches you.  So with regard to children, wife, office, riches; and you will
some time or other be worthy to feast with the gods.  And if you do not so much
as take the things which are set before you, but are able even to forego them,
then you will not only be worthy to feast with the gods, but to rule with them
also. For, by thus doing, Diogenes and Heraclitus, and others like them,
deservedly became divine, and were so recognized.
