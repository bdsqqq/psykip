If you wish your children and your wife and your friends to live forever, you
are foolish; for you wish things to be in your power which are not so; and what
belongs to others to be your own. So likewise, if you wish your servant to be
without fault, you are foolish; for you wish vice not to be vice, but something
else. But if you wish not to be disappointed in your desires, that is in your
own power. Exercise, therefore, what is in your power. A man's master is he who
is able to confer or remove whatever that man seeks or shuns. Whoever then
would be free, let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on
others; else he must necessarily be a slave.
