##  16

When you see any one weeping for grief, either that his son has gone abroad, or
that he has suffered in his affairs, take care not to be overcome by the
apparent evil; but discriminate, and be ready to say, "What hurts this man is
not this occurrence itself,- for another man might not be hurt by it, - but the
view he chooses to take of it."  As far as conversation goes, however, do not
disdain to accommodate yourself to him, and if need be, to groan with him. Take
heed, however, not to groan inwardly too.
