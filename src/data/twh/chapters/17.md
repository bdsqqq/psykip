Remember that you are an actor in a drama of such sort as the author chooses, -
if short, then in a short one; if long, then in a long one. If it be his
pleasure that you should enact a poor man, see that you act it well; or a
cripple, or a ruler, or a private citizen. For this is your business, to act
well the given part; but to choose it, belongs to another.
