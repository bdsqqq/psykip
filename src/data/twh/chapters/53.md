##  53

Upon all occasions we ought to have these maxims
ready at hand: -

"Conduct me, Zeus, and thou, O Destiny,  
Wherever your decrees have fixed my lot.  
I follow cheerfully; and, did I not,  
Wicked and wretched, I must follow still."  
*(Cleanthes, in Diogenes Laertius, quoted also by Seneca, Epistle 107.)*

Whoe'er yields properly to Fate is deemed  
Wise among men, and knows the laws of Heaven.  
*(Euripides, Fragments.)*

And this third: -
O Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be. *(Plato, Crito, 17)*

Anytus and Melitus may kill me indeed; but hurt me they cannot. *(Apology, 18.)*
