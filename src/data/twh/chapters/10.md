##  10

Upon every accident, remember to turn towards yourself and inquire what faculty
you have for its use.  If you encounter a handsome person, you will find
continence the faculty needed; if pain, then fortitude; if reviling, then
patience. And when thus habituated, the phenomena of existence will not
overwhelm you.
