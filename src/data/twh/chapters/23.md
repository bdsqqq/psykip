##  23

If you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, for the pleasure of any
one, be assured that you have ruined your scheme of life. Be contented, then,
in everything, with being a philosopher; and if you wish to seem so likewise to
any one, appear so to yourself, and it will suffice you.
