When someone treats you ill or speaks ill of you, remember that he acts or
speaks thus because he thinks it is incumbent upon him. That being the case, it
is impossible for him to follow what appears good to you, but what appears good
to himself; whence it follows, that, if he gets a wrong view of things, the man
that suffers is the man that has been deceived. For if a person thinks a true
composite judgement to be false, the composite judgement does not suffer, but
the person who has been deceived. If, therefore, you start from this point of
view, you will be gentle with the man who reviles you. For you should say on
each occasion, "He thought that way about it."
