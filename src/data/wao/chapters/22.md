If you yearn for philosophy, prepare at once to be met with ridicule, to have
many people jeer at you, and say, "Here he is again, turned philosopher all of
a sudden," and "Where do you suppose he got that high brow?" But do you not put
on a high brow, and do you so hold fast to the things which to you seem best,
as a man who has been assigned by God to this post; and remember that if you
abide by the same principles, those who formerly used to laugh at you will
later come to admire you, but if you are worsted by them, you will get the
laugh on yourself twice.
