##  36

Just as the propositions, "It is day," and "It is night," are full of meaning
when separated, but meaningless if united; so also, granted that for you to
take the larger share at a dinner is good for your body, still, it is bad for
the maintenance of the proper kind of social feeling. When, therefore, you are
eating with another person, remember to regard, not merely the value for your
body of what lies before you, but also to maintain your respect for your host.
