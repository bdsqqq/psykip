When a raven croaks inauspicfously, let not the external impression carry you
away, but straightway draw a distinction in your own mind, and say, "None of
these portents are for me, but either for my paltry body, or my paltry estate,
or my paltry opinion, or my children, or my wife. But for me every portent is
favourable, if I so wish; for whatever be the outcome, it is within my power to
derive benefit from it."
