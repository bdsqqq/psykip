##  14

If you make it your will that your children and your wife and your friends
should live for ever, you are silly; for you are making it your will that
things not under your control should be under your control, and that what is
not your own should be your own. In the same way, too, if you make it your will
that your slave-boy be free from faults, you are a fool; for you are making it
your will that vice be not vice, but something else. If, however, it is your
will not to fail in what you desire, this is in your power. Wherefore, exercise
yourself in that which is in your power. Each man's master is the person who
has the authority over what the man wishes or does not wish, so as to secure
it, or take it away. Whoever, therefore, wants to be free, let him neither wish
for anything, nor avoid anything, that is under the control of others; or else
he is necessarily a slave.
