Some things are under our control, while others are not under our control.
Under our control are conception, choice, desire, aversion, and, in a word,
everything that is our own doing; not under our control are our body, our
property, reputation, office, and, in a word, everything that is not our own
doing. Furthermore, the things under our control are by nature free,
unhindered, and unimpeded; while the things not under our control are weak,
servile, subject to hindrance, and not our own. Remember, therefore, that if
what is naturally slavish you think to be free, and what is not your own to be
your own, you will be hampered, will grieve, will be in turmoil, and will blame
both gods and men; while if you think only what is your own to be your own, and
what is not your own to be, as it really is, not your own, then no one will
ever be able to exert compulsion upon you, no one will hinder you, you will
blame no one, will find fault with no one, will do absolutely nothing against
your will, you will have no personal enemy, no one will harm you, for neither
is there any harm that can touch you.

With such high aims, therefore, remember that you must bestir yourself with no
slight effort to lay hold of them, but you will have to give up some things
entirely, and defer others for the time being. But if you wish for these things
also, and at the same time for both office and wealth, it may be that you will
not get even these latter, because you aim also at the former, and certainly
you will fail to get the former, which alone bring freedom and happiness.

Make it, therefore, your study at the very outset to say to every harsh
external impression, "You are an external impression and not at all what you
appear to be." After that examine it and test it by these rules which you have,
the first and most important of which is this: Whether the impression has to do
with the things which are under our control, or with those which are not under
our control; and, if it has to do with some one of the things not under our
control, have ready to hand the answer, "It is nothing to me."
