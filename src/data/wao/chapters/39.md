##  39

Each man's body is a measure for his property, just as the foot is a measure
for his shoe. If, then, you abide by this principle, you will maintain the
proper measure, but if you go beyond it, you cannot help but fall headlong over
a precipice, as it were, in the end. So also in the case of your shoe; if once
you go beyond the foot, you get first a gilded shoe, then a purple one, then an
embroidered one. For once you go beyond the measure there is no limit.
