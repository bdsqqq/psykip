It is not the things themselves that disturb men, but their judgements about
these things. For example, death is nothing dreadful, or else Socrates too
would have thought so, but the judgement that death is dreadful, this is the
dreadful thing. When, therefore, we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let
us never blame anyone but ourselves, that means, our own judgements. It is the
part of an uneducated person to blame others where he himself fares ill; to
blame himself is the part of one whose education has begun; to blame neither
another nor his own self is the part of one whose education is already
complete.
