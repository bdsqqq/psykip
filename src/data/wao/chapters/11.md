##  11

Never say about anything, "I have lost it," but only "I have given it back." Is
your child dead? It has been given back. Is your wife dead? She has been given
back. "I have had my farm taken away." Very well, this too has been given back.
"Yet it was a rascal who took it away." But what concern is it of yours by
whose instrumentality the Giver called for its return? So long as He gives it
you, take care of it as of a thing that is not your own, as travellers treat
their inn.
