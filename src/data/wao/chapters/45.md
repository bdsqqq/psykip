Somebody is hasty about bathing; do not say that he bathes badly, but that he
is hasty about bathing. Somebody drinks a good deal of wine; do not say that he
drinks badly, but that he drinks a good deal. For until you have decided what
judgement prompts him, how do you know that what he is doing is bad? And thus
the final result will not be that you receive convincing sense-impressions of
some things, but give your assent to others.
