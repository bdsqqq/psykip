If it should ever happen to you that you turn to externals with a view to
pleasing someone, rest assured that you have lost your plan of life. Be
content, therefore, in everything to be a philosopher, and if you wish also to
be taken for one, show to yourself that you are one, and you will be able to
accomplish it.
