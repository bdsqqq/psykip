When you see someone weeping in sorrow, either because a child has gone on a
journey, or because he has lost his property, beware that you be not carried
away by the impression that the man is in the midst of external ills, but
straightway keep before you this thought: "It is not what has happened that
distresses this man (for it does not distress another), but his judgement about
it." Do not, however, hesitate to sympathize with him so far as words go, and,
if occasion offers, even to groan with him; but be careful not to groan also in
the centre of your being.
