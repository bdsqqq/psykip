##  53

Upon every occasion we ought to have the following thoughts at our command:

Lead thou me on, O Zeus, and Destiny,  
To that goal long ago to me assigned.  
I'll follow and not falter; if my will  
Prove weak and craven, still I'll follow on.

"Whoso has rightly with necessity complied,  
We count him wise, and skilled in things divine."

"Well, O Crito, if so it is pleasing to the gods, so let it be."

"Anytus and Meletus can kill me, but they cannot hurt me."
