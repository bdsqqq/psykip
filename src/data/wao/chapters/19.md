##  19

You can be invincible if you never enter a contest in which victory is not
under your control. Beware lest, when you see some person preferred to you in
honour, or possessing great power, or otherwise enjoying high repute, you are
ever carried away by the external impression, and deem him happy. For if the
true nature of the good is one of the things that are under our control, there
is no place for either envy or jealousy; and you yourself will not wish to be a
praetor, or a senator, or a consul, but a free man. Now there is but one way
that leads to this, and that is to despise the things that are not under our
control.
