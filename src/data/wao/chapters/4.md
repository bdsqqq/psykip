##  4

When you are on the point of putting your hand to some undertaking, remind
yourself what the nature of that undertaking is. If you are going out of the
house to bathe, put before your mind what happens at a public bathâ€”those who
splash you with water, those who jostle against you, those who vilify you and
rob you. And thus you will set about your undertaking more securely if at the
outset you say to yourself, "I want to take a bath, and, at the same time, to
keep my moral purpose in harmony with nature." And so do in every undertaking.
For thus, if anything happens to hinder you in your bathing, you will be ready
to say, "Oh, well, this was not the only thing that I wanted, but I wanted also
to keep my moral purpose in harmony with nature; and I shall not so keep it if
I am vexed at what is going on."
