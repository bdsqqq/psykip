Everything has two handles, by one of which it ought to be carried and by the
other not. If your brother wrongs you, do not lay hold of the matter by the
handle of the wrong that he is doing, because this is the handle by which the
matter ought not to be carried; but rather by the other handleâ€”that he is your
brother, that you were brought up together, and then you will be laying hold of
the matter by the handle by which it ought to be carried.
