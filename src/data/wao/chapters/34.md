When you get an external impression of some pleasure, guard yourself, as with
impressions in general, against being carried away by it; nay, let the matter
wait upon your leisure, and give yourself a little delay. Next think of the two
periods of time, first, that in which you will enjoy your pleasure, and second,
that in which, after the enjoyment is over, you will later repent and revile
your own self; and set over against these two periods of time how much joy and
self-satisfaction you will get if you refrain. However, if you feel that a
suitable occasion has arisen to do the deed, be careful not to allow its
enticement, and sweetness, and attractiveness to overcome you; but set over
against all this the thought, how much better is the consciousness of having
won a victory over it.
