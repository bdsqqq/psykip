Be not elated at any excellence which is not your own. If the horse in his
elation were to say, "I am beautiful," it could be endured; but when you say in
your elation, "I have a beautiful horse," rest assured that you are elated at
something good which belongs to a horse. What, then, is your own? The use of
external impressions. Therefore, when you are in harmony with nature in the use
of external impressions, then be elated; for then it will be some good of your
own at which you will be elated.
