Immediately after they are fourteen, women are called "ladies" by men. And so
when they see that they have nothing else but only to be the bed-fellows of
men, they begin to beautify themselves, and put all their hopes in that. It is
worth while for us to take pains, therefore, to make them understand that they
are honoured for nothing else but only for appearing modest and
self-respecting.
