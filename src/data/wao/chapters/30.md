##  30

Our duties are in general measured by our social relationships. He is a father.
One is called upon to take care of him, to give way to him in all things, to
submit when he reviles or strikes you. "But he is a bad father." Did nature,
then, bring you into relationship with a good father? No, but simply with a
father. "My brother does me wrong." Very well, then, maintain the relation that
you have toward him; and do not consider what he is doing, but what you will
have to do, if your moral purpose is to be in harmony with nature. For no one
will harm you without your consent; you will have been harmed only when you
think you are harmed. In this way, therefore, you will discover what duty to
expect of your neighbour, your citizen, your commanding officer, if you acquire
the habit of looking at your social relations with them.
