##  49

When a person gives himself airs because he can understand and interpret the
books of Chrysippus, say to yourself, "If Chrysippus had not written obscurely,
this man would have nothing about which to give himself airs."

But what is it I want? To learn nature and to follow her. I seek, therefore,
someone to interpret her; and having heard that Chrysippus does so, I go to
him. But I do not understand what he has written; I seek, therefore, the person
who interprets Chrysippus. And down to this point there is nothing to justify
pride. But when I find the interpreter, what remains is to put his precepts
into practice; this is the only thing to be proud about. If, however, I admire
the mere act of interpretation, what have I done but turned into a grammarian
instead of a philosopher? The only difference, indeed, is that I interpret
Chrysippus instead of Homer. Far from being proud, therefore, when somebody
says to me, "Read me Chrysippus," I blush the rather, when I am unable to show
him such deeds as match and harmonize with his words.
