##  12

If you wish to make progress, dismiss all reasoning of this sort: "If I neglect
my affairs, I shall have nothing to live on." "If I do not punish my slave-boy
he will turn out bad." For it is better to die of hunger, but in a state of
freedom from grief and fear, than to live in plenty, but troubled in mind. And
it is better for your slave-boy to be bad than for you to be unhappy. Begin,
therefore, with the little things. Your paltry oil gets spilled, your miserable
wine stolen; say to yourself, "This is the price paid for a calm spirit, this
the price for peace of mind." Nothing is got without a price. And when you call
your slave-boy, bear in mind that it is possible he may not heed you, and
again, that even if he does heed, he may not do what you want done. But he is
not in so happy a condition that your peace of mind depends upon him.
