When you imagine some pleasure, beware that it does not carry you away, like
other imaginations. Wait a while, and give yourself pause. Next remember two
things: how long you will enjoy the pleasure, and also how long you will
afterwards repent and revile yourself. And set on the other side the joy and
self-satisfaction you will feel if you refrain. And if the moment seems come to
realize it, take heed that you be not overcome by the winning sweetness and
attraction of it; set in the other scale the thought how much better is the
consciousness of having vanquished it.
