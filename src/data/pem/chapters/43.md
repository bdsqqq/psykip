##  43

Everything has two handles, one by which you can carry it, the other by which
you cannot. If your brother wrongs you, do not take it by that handle, the
handle of his wrong, for you cannot carry it by that, but rather by the other
handleâ€”that he is a brother, brought up with you, and then you will take it by
the handle that you can carry by.
