##  26

It is in our power to discover the will of Nature from those matters on which
we have no difference of opinion. For instance, when another man's slave has
broken the wine-cup we are very ready to say at once, 'Such things must
happen'. Know then that when your own cup is broken, you ought to behave in the
same way as when your neighbour's was broken. Apply the same principle to
higher matters. Is another's child or wife dead? Not one of us but would say,
'Such is the lot of man'; but when one's own dies, straightway one cries,
'Alas! miserable am I'. But we ought to remember what our feelings are when we
hear it of another.
