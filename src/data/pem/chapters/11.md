##  11

Never say of anything, 'I lost it', but say, 'I gave it back'. Has your child
died? It was given back. Has your wife died? She was given back. Has your
estate been taken from you? Was not this also given back? But you say, 'He who
took it from me is wicked'. What does it matter to you through whom the Giver
asked it back? As long as He gives it you, take care of it, but not as your
own; treat it as passers-by treat an inn.
