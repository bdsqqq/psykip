The first and most necessary department of philosophy deals with the
application of principles; for instance, 'not to lie'. The second deals with
demonstrations; for instance, 'How comes it that one ought not to lie?' The
third is concerned with establishing and analysing these processes; for
instance, 'How comes it that this is a demonstration? What is demonstration,
what is consequence, what is contradiction, what is true, what is false?' It
follows then that the third department is necessary because of the second, and
the second because of the first. The first is the most necessary part, and that
in which we must rest. But we reverse the order: we occupy ourselves with the
third, and make that our whole concern, and the first we completely neglect.
Wherefore we lie, but are ready enough with the demonstration that lying is
wrong.
