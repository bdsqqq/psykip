##  16

When you see a man shedding tears in sorrow for a child abroad or dead, or for
loss of property, beware that you are not carried away by the impression that
it is outward ills that make him miserable. Keep this thought by you: 'What
distresses him is not the event, for that does not distress another, but his
judgement on the event.' Therefore do not hesitate to sympathize with him so
far as words go, and if it so chance, even to groan with him; but take heed
that you do not also groan in your inner being.
