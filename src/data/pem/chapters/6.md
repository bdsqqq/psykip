##  6

Be not elated at an excellence which is not your own. If the horse in his pride
were to say, 'I am handsome', we could bear with it. But when you say with
pride, 'I have a handsome horse', know that the good horse is the ground of
your pride. You ask then what you can call your own. The answer isâ€”the way you
deal with your impressions. Therefore when you deal with your impressions in
accord with nature, then you may be proud indeed, for your pride will be in a
good which is your own.
