##  12

If you wish to make progress, abandon reasonings of this sort: 'If I neglect my
affairs I shall have nothing to live on'; 'If I do not punish my son, he will
be wicked.' For it is better to die of hunger, so that you be free from pain
and free from fear, than to live in plenty and be troubled in mind. It is
better for your son to be wicked than for you to be miserable. Wherefore begin
with little things. Is your drop of oil spilt? Is your sup of wine stolen? Say
to yourself, 'This is the price paid for freedom from passion, this is the
price of a quiet mind.' Nothing can be had without a price. When you call your
slave-boy, reflect that he may not be able to hear you, and if he hears you, he
may not be able to do anything you want. But he is not so well off that it
rests with him to give you peace of mind.
