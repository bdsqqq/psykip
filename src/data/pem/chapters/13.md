##  13

If you wish to make progress, you must be content in external matters to seem a
fool and a simpleton; do not wish men to think you know anything, and if any
should think you to be somebody, distrust yourself. For know that it is not
easy to keep your will in accord with nature and at the same time keep outward
things; if you attend to one you must needs neglect the other.
