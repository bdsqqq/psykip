Appropriate acts are in general measured by the relations they are concerned
with. 'He is your father.' This means you are called on to take care of him,
give way to him in all things, bear with him if he reviles or strikes you.

'But he is a bad father.'

Well, have you any natural claim to a good father? No, only to a father.

'My brother wrongs me.'

Be careful then to maintain the relation you hold to him, and do not consider
what he does, but what you must do if your purpose is to keep in accord with
nature. For no one shall harm you, without your consent; you will only be
harmed, when you think you are harmed. You will only discover what is proper to
expect from neighbour, citizen, or praetor, if you get into the habit of
looking at the relations implied by each.
