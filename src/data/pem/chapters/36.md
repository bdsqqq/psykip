The phrases, 'It is day' and 'It is night', mean a great deal if taken
separately, but have no meaning if combined. In the same way, to choose the
larger portion at a banquet may be worth while for your body, but if you want
to maintain social decencies it is worthless. Therefore, when you are at meat
with another, remember not only to consider the value of what is set before you
for the body, but also to maintain your self-respect before your host.
