##  7

When you are on a voyage, and your ship is at anchorage, and you disembark to
get fresh water, you may pick up a small shellfish or a truffle by the way, but
you must keep your attention fixed on the ship, and keep looking towards it
constantly, to see if the Helmsman calls you; and if he does, you have to leave
everything, or be bundled on board with your legs tied like a sheep. So it is
in life. If you have a dear wife or child given you, they are like the
shellfish or the truffle, they are very well in their way. Only, if the
Helmsman call, run back to your ship, leave all else, and do not look behind
you. And if you are old, never go far from the ship, so that when you are
called you may not fail to appear.
