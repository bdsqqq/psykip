Remember that you must behave in life as you would at a banquet. A dish is
handed round and comes to you; put out your hand and take it politely. It
passes you; do not stop it. It has not reached you; do not be impatient to get
it, but wait till your turn comes. Bear yourself thus towards children, wife,
office, wealth, and one day you will be worthy to banquet with the gods. But if
when they are set before you, you do not take them but despise them, then you
shall not only share the godsâ€™ banquet, but shall share their rule. For by so
doing Diogenes and Heraclitus and men like them were called divine and deserved
the name.
