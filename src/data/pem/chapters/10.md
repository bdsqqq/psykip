When anything happens to you, always remember to turn to yourself and ask what
faculty you have to deal with it. If you see a beautiful boy or a beautiful
woman, you will find continence the faculty to exercise there; if trouble is
laid on you, you will find endurance; if ribaldry, you will find patience. And
if you train yourself in this habit your impressions will not carry you away.
