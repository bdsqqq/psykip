If a man wash quickly, do not say that he washes badly, but that he washes
quickly. If a man drink much wine, do not say that he drinks badly, but that he
drinks much. For till you have decided what judgement prompts him, how do you
know that he acts badly? If you do as I say, you will assent to your
apprehensive impressions and to none other.
