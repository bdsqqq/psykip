What disturbs men's minds is not events but their judgements on events: For
instance, death is nothing dreadful, or else Socrates would have thought it so.
No, the only dreadful thing about it is men's judgement that it is dreadful.
And so when we are hindered, or disturbed, or distressed, let us never lay the
blame on others, but on ourselves, that is, on our own judgements. To accuse
others for one's own misfortunes is a sign of want of education; to accuse
oneself shows that one's education has begun; to accuse neither oneself nor
others shows that one's education is complete.
