If you set your desire on philosophy you must at once prepare to meet with
ridicule and the jeers of many who will say, 'Here he is again, turned
philosopher. Where has he got these proud looks?' Nay, put on no proud looks,
but hold fast to what seems best to you, in confidence that God has set you at
this post. And remember that if you abide where you are, those who first laugh
at you will one day admire you, and that if you give way to them, you will get
doubly laughed at.
