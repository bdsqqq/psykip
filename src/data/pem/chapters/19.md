You can be invincible, if you never enter on a contest where victory is not in
your power. Beware then that when you see a man raised to honour or great power
or high repute you do not let your impression carry you away.  For if the
reality of good lies in what is in our power, there is no room for envy or
jealousy. And you will not wish to be praetor, or prefect or consul, but to be
free; and there is but one way to freedomâ€”to despise what is not in our power.
