When you are about to take something in hand, remind yourself what manner of
thing it is. If you are going to bathe put before your mind what happens in the
bathâ€”water pouring over some, others being jostled,. some reviling, others
stealing; and you will set to work more securely if you say to yourself at
once: 'I want to bathe, and I want to keep my will in harmony with nature,' and
so in each thing you do; for in this way, if anything turns up to hinder you in
your bathing, you will be ready to say, 'I did not want only to bathe, but to
keep my will in harmony with nature, and I shall not so keep it, if I lose my
temper at what happens'.
