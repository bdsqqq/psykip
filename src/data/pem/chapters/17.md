Remember that you are an actor in a play, and the Playwright chooses the manner
of it: if he wants it short, it is short; if long, it is long. If he wants you
to act a poor man you must act the part with all your powers; and so if your
part be a cripple or a magistrate or a plain man. For your business is to act
the character that is given you and act it well; the choice of the cast is
Another's.
