When a raven croaks with evil omen, let not the impression carry you away, but
straightway distinguish in your own mind and say, 'These portents mean nothing
to me; but only to my bit of a body or my bit of property or name, or my
children or my wife. But for me all omens are favourable if I will, for,
whatever the issue may be, it is in my power to pt benefit therefrom.'
