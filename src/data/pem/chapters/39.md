Every man's body is a measure for his property, as the foot is the measure for
his shoe. If you stick to this limit, you will keep the right measure; if you
go beyond it, you are bound to be carried away down a precipice in the end;
just as with the shoe, if you once go beyond the foot, your shoe puts on
gilding, and soon purple and embroidery. For when once you go beyond the
measure there is no limit.
