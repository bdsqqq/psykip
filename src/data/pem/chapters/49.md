##  49

When a man prides himself on being able to understand and interpret the books
of Chrysippus, say to yourself, 'If Chrysippus had not written obscurely this
man would have had nothing on which to pride himself.'

What is my object? To understand Nature and follow her. I look then for some
one who interprets her, and having heard that Chrysippus does

I come to him. But I do not understand his writings, so I seek an interpreter.
So far there is nothing to be proud of. But when I have found the interpreter
it remains for me to act on his precepts; that and that alone is a thing to be
proud of. But if I admire the mere power of exposition, it comes to thisâ€”that I
am turned into a grammarian instead of a philosopher, except that I interpret
Chrysippus in place of Homer.  Therefore, when some one says to me, 'Read me
Chrysippus', when I cannot point to actions which are in harmony and
correspondence with his teaching, I am rather inclined to blush.
