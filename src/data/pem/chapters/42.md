When a man speaks evil or does evil to you, remember that he does or says it
because he thinks it is fitting for him. It is not possible for him to follow
what seems good to you, but only what seems good to him, so that, if his
opinion is wrong, he suffers, in that he is the victim of deception. In the
same way, if a composite judgement which is true is thought to be false, it is
not the judgement that suffers, but the man who is deluded about it. If you act
on this principle you will be gentle to him who reviles you, saying to yourself
on each occasion, 'He thought it right.'
