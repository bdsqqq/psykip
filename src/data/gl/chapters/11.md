Never say about anything, I have lost it, but say I have restored it. Is your
child dead? It has been restored. Is your wife dead? She has been restored. Has
your estate been taken from you? Has not then this also been restored? But he
who has taken it from me is a bad man. But what is it to you, by whose hands
the giver demanded it back? So long as he may allow you, take care of it as a
thing which belongs to another, as travelers do with their inn.
