##  7

As on a voyage when the vessel has reached a port, if you go out to get water,
it is an amusement by the way to pick up a shellfish or some bulb, but your
thoughts ought to be directed to the ship, and you ought to be constantly
watching if the captain should call, and then you must throw away all those
things, that you may not be bound and pitched into the ship like sheep: so in
life also, if there be given to you instead of a little bulb and a shell a wife
and child, there will be nothing to prevent (you from taking them). But if the
captain should call, run to the ship, and leave all those things without regard
to them. But if you are old, do not even go far from the ship, lest when you
are called you make default.
