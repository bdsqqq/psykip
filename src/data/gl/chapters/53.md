##  53

In every thing (circumstance) we should hold these maxims ready to hand:

Lead me, O Zeus, and thou O Destiny,  
The way that I am bid by you to go:  
To follow I am ready. If I choose not,  
I make myself a wretch, and still must follow.

But whoso nobly yields unto necessity,  
We hold him wise, and skill'd in things divine.

And the third also:

O Crito, if so it pleases the gods, so let it be;  
Anytus and Melitus are able indeed to kill me, but they cannot harm me.
