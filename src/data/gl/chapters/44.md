##  44

These reasonings do not cohere: I am richer than you, therefore I am better
than you; I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better than you. On the
contrary these rather cohere, I am richer than you, therefore my possessions
are greater than yours: I am more eloquent than you, therefore my speech is
superior to yours. But you are neither possession nor speech.
