In everything which pleases the soul, or supplies a want, or is loved, remember
to add this to the (description, notion): What is the nature of each thing,
beginning from the smallest? If you love an earthen vessel, say it is an
earthen vessel which you love; for when it has been broken, you will not be
disturbed. If you are kissing your child or wife, say that it is a human being
whom you are kissing, for when the wife or child dies, you will not be
disturbed.
