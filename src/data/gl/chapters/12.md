##  12

If you intend to improve, throw away such thoughts as these: if I neglect my
affairs, I shall not have the means of living: unless I chastise my slave, he
will be bad. For it is better to die of hunger and so to be released from grief
and fear than to live in abundance with perturbation; and it is better for your
slave to be bad than for you to be unhappy. Begin then from little things. Is
the oil spilled? Is a little wine stolen? Say on the occasion, at such price is
sold freedom from perturbation; at such price is sold tranquility, but nothing
is got for nothing. And when you call your slave, consider that it is possible
that he does not hear; and if he does hear, that he will do nothing which you
wish. But matters are not so well with him, but altogether well with you, that
it should be in his power for you to be not disturbed.
