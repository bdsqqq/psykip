##  36

As the proposition it is either day or it is night is of great importance for
the disjunctive argument, but for the conjunctive is of no value, so in a
symposium (entertainment) to select the larger share is of great value for the
body, but for the maintenance of the social feeling is worth nothing. When then
you are eating with another, remember to look not only to the value for the
body of the things set before you, but also to the value of the behavior toward
the host which ought to be observed.
