If you would improve, submit to be considered without sense and foolish with
respect to externals. Wish to be considered to know nothing: and if you shall
seem to some to be a person of importance, distrust yourself. For you should
know that it is not easy both to keep your will in a condition conformable to
nature and (to secure) external things: but if a man is careful about the one,
it is an absolute necessity that he will neglect the other.
