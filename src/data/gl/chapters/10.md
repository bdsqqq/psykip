On the occasion of every accident (event) that befalls you, remember to turn to
yourself and inquire what power you have for turning it to use. If you see a
fair man or a fair woman, you will find that the power to resist is temperance
(continence). If labor (pain) be presented to you, you will find that it is
endurance. If it be abusive words, you will find it to be patience. And if you
have been thus formed to the (proper) habit, the appearances will not carry you
along with them.
