When you are going to take in hand any act, remind yourself what kind of an act
it is. If you are going to bathe, place before yourself what happens in the
bath: some splashing the water, others pushing against one another, others
abusing one another, and some stealing: and thus with more safety you will
undertake the matter, if you say to yourself, I now intend to bathe, and to
maintain my will in a manner conÂ­formable to nature. And so you will do in
every act: for thus if any hindrance to bathing shall happen, let this thought
be ready; it was not this only that I intended, but I intended also to maintain
my will in a way conformable to nature; but I shall not maintain it so, if I am
vexed at what happens.
