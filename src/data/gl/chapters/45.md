Does a man bathe quickly (early)? Do not say that he bathes badly, but that he
bathes quickly. Does a man drink much wine? Do not say that he does this badly,
but say that he drinks much. For before you shall have determined the opinion,
how do you know whether he is acting wrong? Thus it will not happen to you to
comprehend some appearances which are capable of being comprehended, but to
assent to others.
