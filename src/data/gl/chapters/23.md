##  23

If it should ever happen to you to be turned to externals in order to please
some person, you must know that you have lost your purpose in life. Be
satisfied, then, in every­thing with being a philosopher; and if you wish to
seem also to any person to be a philosopher, appear so to your­self, and you
will be able to do this.
