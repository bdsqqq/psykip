You can be invincible, if you enter into no contest in which it is not in your
power to conquer. Take care, then, when you observe a man honored before others
or possessed of great power or highly esteemed for any reason, not to suppose
him happy, and be not carried away by the appearance. For if the nature of the
good is in our power, neither envy nor jealousy will have a place in us. But
you yourself will not wish to be a general or senator or consul, but a free
man: and there is only one way to this, to despise (care not for) the things
which are not in our power.
