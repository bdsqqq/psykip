##  35

When you have decided that a thing ought to be done and are doing it, never
avoid being seen doing it, though the many shall form an unfavorable opinion
about it. For if it is not right to do it, avoid doing the thing; but if it is
right, why are you afraid of those who shall find fault wrongly?
