##  6

Be not elated at any advantage (excellence), which belongs to another. If a
horse when he is elated should say, I am beautiful, one might endure it. But
when you are elated, and say, I have a beautiful horse, you must know that you
are elated at having a good horse. What then is your own? The use of
appearances. Consequently, when in the use of appearances you are conformable
to nature, then be elated, for then you will be elated at something good which
is your own.
