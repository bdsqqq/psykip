The condition and characteristic of an uninstructed person is this: he never
expects from himself profit (advantage) nor harm, but from externals. The
condition and characteristic of a philosopher is this: he expects all advantage
and all harm from himself. The signs (marks) of one who is making progress are
these: he censures no man, he praises no man, he blames no man, he accuses no
man, he says nothing about himself as if he were somebody or knew something;
when he is impeded at all or hindered, he blames himself: if a man praises him,
he ridicules the praiser to himself: if a man censures him, he makes no
defense: he goes about like weak persons, being careful not to move any of the
things which are placed, before they are firmly fixed: he removes all desire
from himself, and he transfers aversion to those things only of the things
within our power which are contrary to nature: he employs a moderate movement
toward everything: whether he is considered foolish or ignorant, he cares not:
and in a word he watches himself as if he were an enemy and lying in ambush.
