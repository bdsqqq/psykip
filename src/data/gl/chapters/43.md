##  43

Everything has two handles, the one by which it may be borne, the other by
which it may not. If your brother acts unjustly, do not lay hold of the act by
that handle wherein he acts unjustly, for this is the handle which cannot be
borne; but lay hold of the other, that he is your brother, that he was nurtured
with you, and you will lay hold of the thing by that handle by which it can be
borne.
