##  5

Men are disturbed not by the things which happen, but by the opinions about the
things: for example, death is nothing terrible, for if it were, it would have
seemed so to Socrates; for the opinion about death, that it is terrible, is the
terrible thing. When then, we are impeded or disÂ­turbed or grieved, let us
never blame others, but ourselves, that is, our opinions. It is the act of an
ill-instructed man to blame others for his own bad condition; it is the act of
one who has begun to be instructed, to lay the blame on himself; and of one
whose instruction is completed, neither to blame another, nor himself.
