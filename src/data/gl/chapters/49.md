When a man is proud because he can understand and explain the writings of
Chrysippus, say to yourself, If Chrysippus had not written obscurely, this man
would have nothing to be proud of. But what is it that I wish? To understand
Nature and to follow it. I inquire, therefore, who is the interpreter: and when
I have heard that it is Chrysippus, I come to him (the interpreter). But I do
not understand what is written, and therefore I seek the interpreter. And so
far there is yet nothing to be proud of. But when I shall have found the
interpreter, the thing that remains is to use the precepts (the lessons). This
itself is the only thing to be proud of. But if I shall admire the exposition,
what else have I been made unless a grammarian instead of a philosopher? except
in one thing, that I am explaining Chrysippus instead of Homer. When, then, any
man says to me, Read Chrysippus to me, I rather blush, when I cannot show my
acts like to and consistent with his words.
