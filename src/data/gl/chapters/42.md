##  42

When any person treats you ill or speaks ill of you, remember that he does this
or says this because he thinks that it is his duty. It is not possible, then,
for him to follow that which seems right to you, but that which seems right to
himself. Accordingly, if he is wrong in his opinion, he is the person who is
hurt, for he is the person who has been deceived; for if a man shall suppose
the true conjunction to be false, it is not the conjunction which is hindered,
but the man who has been deceived about it. If you proceed, then, from these
opinions, you will be mild in temper to him who reviles you: for say on each
occasion, It seemed so to him.
