##  22

If you desire philosophy, prepare yourself from the be­ginning to be ridiculed,
to expect that many will sneer at you, and say, He has all at once returned to
us as a phi­losopher; and whence does he get this supercilious look for us? Do
you not show a supercilious look; but hold on to the things which seem to you
best as one appointed by God to this station. And remember that if you abide in
the same principles, these men who first ridiculed will afterward admire you:
but if you shall have been over­powered by them, you will bring on yourself
double ridicule.
