##  26

We may learn the wish (will) of nature from the things in which we do not
differ from one another; for instance, when your neighbor's slave has broken
his cup, or anything else, we are ready to say forthwith, that it is one of the
things which happen. You must know, then, that when your cup also is broken,
you ought to think as you did when your neighbor's cup was broken. Transfer
this reflection to greater things also. Is another man's child or wife dead?
There is no one who would not say, this is an event incident to man. But when a
man's own child or wife is dead, forthwith he calls out, Woe to me, how
wretched I am. But we ought to remember how we feel when we hear that it has
happened to others.
