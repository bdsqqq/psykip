##  47

When you have harmonized yourself to a frugal provision for your bodily needs,
do not pride yourself on that; and if your drink is water, do not take every
opportunity of declaring I am a water drinker. And if you wish at any time
to inure yourself to labour and endurance, do it unto yourself and not unto
the world, and do not embrace the statues, but some time when you are
exceedingly thirsty take a draught of cold water into your mouth, and spit
it out, and say nothing about it.
