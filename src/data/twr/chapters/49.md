##  49

When someone himself on act of his powers of understanding and expounding the
writings Chrysippus, then say to yourself, If Chrysippus had not written
obscurely, this man would have nothing  whereon to exalt himself. But I, what
do I desire? Is it not to learn to understand Nature and to follow her? I
inquire, then, who can expound Nature to me and hearing that Chrysippus
can, I betake myself to him. But I do not understand his writings,
therefore I seek an expounder for them. And so far there is nothing
exalted. But when I have found the expounder, it remains for me to put into
practice what he declares to me; and in this alone is there anything
exalted. But if I look on the exposition as a thing to be admired in
itself, what else am I become than a grammarian instead of a sage? except
that the exposition is not of Homer but of Chrysippus. Therefore when one
may ask me to lecture on the philosophy of Chrysippus, I shall rather blush
when I am not able to show forth works of a like nature and in harmony with
the words.
