If you set your heart upon philosophy, you must straightway prepare yourself to
be laughed at and mocked by many who will say *Behold a philosopher  arisen
among us! or How came you by that brow of scorn?* But do you cherish no scorn,
but hold to those things which seem to you the best, as one set by God in that
place. Remember too, that if you abide in those ways, those who first mocked
you, the same shall afterwards reverence you; but if you yield to them, you
will be laughed at twice as much as before.
