##  6

Be not puffed-up on account of any that is not of yourself.  If your horse were
proud and should say, *I am beautiful,* that would be tolerable.  But when you
are proud, and say, *I have a beautiful horse,* how that it is an excellence in
your horse that you are proud of.  What then is really your own?  This, to make
use of the phantasms. So that when you deal according to Nature in your use of
the phantasms,  then you may pride yourself, for then you will be priding
yourself on an excellence which is really your own.
