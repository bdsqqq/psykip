Remember that it is not he who strikes you or he who reviles you who does you
an injury, but the opinion you have about the things, that they are injurious.
Therefore when someone shall provoke you to wrath, know that you are provoked
by your own conception. Strive then at the outset not to be rapt-away by the
phantasm; for if you shall once succeed in gaining time and delay you will more
easily master yourself.
