Remember that you are an actor in a drama, of such a part as it may please the
master to assign you, for a long time or for a little as he may choose.  And if
he will you to take the part of a poor man, or  a cripple, or a ruler, or a
private citizen, then may you act that part with grace! For to act well the
part that is allotted to us, that indeed is ours to do, but to choose it is
anotherâ€™s.
