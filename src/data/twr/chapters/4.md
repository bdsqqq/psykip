When you are about to take in hand some action, bethink yourself what it
really. Is that you are about to do If you propose to go to the bath, represent
to yourself all the things that take place at the bathing establishment, the
squirting of water, the beating, the bad language, the theft. And after this
fashion you will take the matter more safely in hand if you say *I intend simply
to bathe, and to maintain my purpose according to Nature.* And similarly with
every action. For thus if anythingâ€™ should occur to cross you in your bathing,
you will instantly think *I did not only intend to bathe, but also that my
purpose should be maintained according to Nature. But it will not be so
maintained lf I let myself be vexed at what occurs.*
