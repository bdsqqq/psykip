##  15

Bear in mind that you should conduct yourself in life as at a feast. Is some
dish brought to you? Then put forth your hand and help yourself in seemly
fashion. Does it pass you by? Then do not hold it back. Has it not yet come to
you? Then do not stretch out for it at a distance, but wait till it is at your
hand. And thus doing with regard to children, and wife, and authority, and
wealth, you will be a worthy guest at the table of the Gods, And if you even
pass over things that are offered to you, and refuse to take of them, then you
will not only share the banquet of the Gods, but also their dominion. For so
doing, Diogenes and Heracleitus and such as they were rightly divine, as they
were said to be.
