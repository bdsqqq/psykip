In the case of everything that allures the mind, or offers an advantage, or is
beloved by you, remember, from the least thing upward, to think of it in its
true nature. For instance, if you like an earthen jar, think *I like an earthen
jar*, for so your mind will not be confounded if it should break.  And if you
love your child or your wife, think *I love a mortal* and so you will not be
confounded when they die.
