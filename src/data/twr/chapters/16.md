##  16

When you shall see one lamenting in grief because his son is gone abroad, or
because he has lost his wealth, see to it that you be not rapt-away by the
phantasm, to think that he has suffered a real misfortune in external matters.
But be the thought at hand, *It is not the fact itself which afflicts this
man—since there are others whom it afflicts not—but the opinion he has
conceived about it.* And do not hesitate as far as words go, to give him your
sympathy, and even, if so it be, to lament with him. But take heed that your
lamenting be not from within.
