There is no nexus in the following reasonings: I am richer than you, therefore
I am superior to you; I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am superior. But
the nexus is rather in these: I am richer than you, therefore my wealth is
superior to yours; I am more eloquent than you, therefore my language is
superior to yours. But you are not wealth, and you are not language.
