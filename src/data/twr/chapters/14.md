##  14

You are quite astray if you desire your wife and children and friends to live
for ever, for then you are desiring things that are not of yourself to be of
yourself, and to control that which is not in your power.  So also if you
desire that your servant never should display any shortcomings, you are a fool;
for that is as much as to desire that imperfection should not be imperfection,
but something else. But If you wish never to fall short of your desires, this
indeed is possible to you; this therefore practice, namely, the practicable.

You own a master when another has power over the things that are pleasing or
displeasing to you, to give them or to take them away. Whosoever then would be
free, let him neither desire nor shun any of the things that depend not upon
himself; otherwise he must needs be enslaved.
