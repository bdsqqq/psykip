You may be always victorious if you will never enter into any contest where the
issue does not  wholly depend upon yourself.

When you see a man honored above others, or mighty in power, or otherwise in
high repute, look to it that you esteem him not blessed, being  rapt-away by
the phantasm.  For if Good, in its essence, be in those things which depend
upon ourselves, then there is no place for jealousy or envy, and you yourself
will not wish to be a general, or a prince, or a consul—but to be free.  And to
this there is but one way — disdain of the things that not up ourselves.
