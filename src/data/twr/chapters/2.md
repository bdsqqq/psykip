Remember that desire announces the aim of attaining the thing desired, and
aversion that of not falling into the thing shunned; and that to miss what you
desire is unfortunate, but it is misfortune to fall into what you shun, But you
can never fall into anything that you shun, if you will shun only things
contrary to Nature which lie within your power: but if you shun disease, or
death, or poverty, you will have misfortune, Withdraw then your aversion from
those things that do not depend upon ourselves, and place it upon those things
contrary to Nature which do depend upon ourselves,

And let desire, for the present, be utterly effaced; for if you are desiring
something of the kind that does not depend upon ourselves, it must needs be
that you miscarry,and of the things that do depend upon ourselves, of such as
you may fairly desire, none are yet open to you. Use therefore only [tentative]
advances and withdrawals, and that but lightly, and with exception, and
indifferently.
