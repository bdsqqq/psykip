##  43

Every matter has two handles; by the one you can carry it, by the other you
cannot. If your brother wrongs you, do not take this by the handle *He wrongs
me,* for by that handle you can not carry it; but take it rather by this, *He
is my brother, nourished with me,* and then you will be taking it by a handle
by which you can carry it.
