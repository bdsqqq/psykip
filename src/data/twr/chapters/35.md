##  35

When you are doing something which you have clearly recognized as being right
to do, do not seek to avoid observation in the act, even though you should know
that the multitude will form a wrong opinion about it, For if you are acting
wrongly, then you should have avoided the action altogether. But if rightly,
why fear those who wrongly rebuke you?
