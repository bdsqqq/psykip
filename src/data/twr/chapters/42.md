##  42

When some one may do you an injury or speak ill of you, remember that he does
it or speaks it under the impression that it is proper for him to do so. He
must then of necessity follow not the appearance which the case presents to
you, but that which it presents to him. Wherefore, if it has a bad appearance
to him, it is he who is injured, being deceived. For if anyone should take a
true statement to be false, it is not the statement which is damaged, but he
who is deceived. If then you set out from these principles, you will bear a
gentle mind towards anyone who reviles you. For say on each occasion, *So it
appeared to him.*
