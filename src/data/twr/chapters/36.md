##  36

As the sayings *It is day, It is night,* are perfectly justifiable if viewed
disjunctively, but unjustifiable if viewed together, even so, at a feast, to
pick out the largest portion for oneself may be justifiable if the act is
viewed merely as it concerns the body, but is unjustifiable if viewed as it
concerns the preservation of the proper community of the feast. Therefore when
you are eating with another person, remember not merely to look at the value
for the body of the things that are set before you, but to preserve also the
reverence due to the giver of the feast.
