If a raven croaks you a bad omen, be not rapt away by the phantasm, but
straightway make a distinction with regard to yourself and say, *This bodes
something perhaps to this poor body or this little property of mine, or to my
reputation, or my wife or children, but to myself, nothing.  For to me, if I
will to have it so, all omens are fortunate.  And whatever of these things may
come to pass, it lies with me to reap some benefit from it.*
