Does a man bathe himself quickly? Then say not Badly, but Quickly. Does be
drink much wine? Then say not Too much, but Much. For before you have discerned
how things appear to him, how can you know if it were done badly? Thus it will
not happen to you to surrender yourself to certain of the phantasms which lay
hold of the mind, while comprehending others.
