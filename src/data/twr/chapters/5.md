It is not things in themselves, but the opinions held about them which trouble
and confuse our minds. Thus, Death is not really terrible — if it were so it
would have appeared so to Socrates— but the opinion about Death, that it is
terrible, that it is wherein the terror lies. Wherefore when we are hindered,
or confounded, or grieved, let us never cast the blame upon others, but upon
our selves; that is, on our opinions of things. A man untaught in philosophy
accuses others on the score of his misfortunes; he who has begun to be taught
accuses himself; he who is fully taught, neither others nor himself.
