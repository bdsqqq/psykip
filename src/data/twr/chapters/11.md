##  11

Never in any case say *I have lost such a thing,* but *I have returned it*. Is
your child dead? it is a return. Is your wife dead? it is a return.  Are you
deprived of your estate? is not this also a return? *But he who deprives me of
it is wicked!* But what is that to you, through whom the giver demands his own!
As long therefore as he grants it to you, steward it like anotherâ€™s property,
as travelers use an inn.
