##  7

Even as in a sea-voyage, when the ship is brought to anchor, and you go out to
fetch in water, you make a bye-work of gathering a few roots and shells upon
the way, but have need ever to keep your mind fixed upon the ship, and
constantly to look round lest at any time the master of the ship should call,
and must, if he call, cast away all those things, lest you be treated like the
sheep that are bound and thrown into the hold: So it is with human life also,
and nothing hinders the comparison if there be given wife and children instead
of shells and roots. And if the master call, run to the ship, forsaking all
those things and looking not behind.  And if you be in old age, go not far from
the ship at any time, lest the master should call, and you should not be ready.
