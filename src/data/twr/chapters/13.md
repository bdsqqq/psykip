##  13

If you wish to advance, you must be content to let people think you senseless
and distraught as regards external things.  Wish not ever to seem wise,  and if
ever you shall find yourself account to be somebody, then mistrust yourself.
For know that it is not an easy matter to make a choice that shall agree both
with external things and with Nature, but it must needs be that he who is
careful of the one shall neglect the other.
