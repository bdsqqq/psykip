##  36

The sentences "It is day" and "It is night" can have meaning separately but
have very little meaning together. Similarly, when you take the largest portion
at dinner, that may be very good for your body, but it's no good at all for
maintaining social feeling. When dining with others, remember not only the
value to your body of a large helping, but also the value of good manners.
