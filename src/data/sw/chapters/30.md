Relations define duties. You've got a father? Then you have duties â€“ helping
him, taking care of him when he's in need, listening to his advice even when
it's reproachful.

You object that you've got a bad father. Are you necessarily related to a good
father? No, only to a father.

Is your brother unfair to you? Don't dwell on his unfairness, but remember that
he's your brother. Instead of analyzing what he does, analyze how you can keep
your attitude calm. No one can harm you unless you let him, and then you're
harmed because you think you are.

Use this method to discover your duties to a neighbor, to the community, to
your boss, and so forth. They're all implicit in the relations.

People aren't Kleenex, and you can't wish away your responsibilities just
because the people involved don't please you all the time.
