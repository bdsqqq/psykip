Does someone wash quickly? Don't say he washes badly, just that he washes
quickly. Does someone drink a lot? Don't say that he drinks badly, just that he
drinks a lot. Unless you know exactly what's behind a person's actions, you
can't determine whether he's doing anything badly. This way you can avoid
making judgements in cases that you don't really understand.
