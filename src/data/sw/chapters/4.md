When you're going to do something, keep the full nature of the activity in
mind. If you're going to a show, picture the way people behave at the theater â€“
pushing, cutting in on lines, arriving late, talking. You'll be better off if
you say to yourself, "I'm going to see this show and I'm going to keep my
attitudes under control." And so with everything you do. Then if anything gets
in the way of your enjoyment of the show, for example, you can say: "My goal
wasn't just to see this show, but to keep my attitudes under control, and I
won't keep them that way if I get irritated at what happens."
