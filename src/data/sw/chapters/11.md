##  11

Never say you've lost anything, only that you've returned it. A dead child?
Returned. A dead spouse? Returned. A home taken away? Returned, too. "But the
people who took it away are no good!" It's not your business what agents the
original giver used to get it back. While he leaves things in your keeping,
take care of them â€“ not as your own, but the way a civilized traveler treats a
hotel room.
