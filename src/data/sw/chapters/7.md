##  7

It's like a short rest stop on a bus trip. You can get some food, use the
bathroom or play some video games. But you'd better watch the time, and keep an
ear on the public-address system, so that you don't miss your departure. And if
you have to leave a bowl of soup or a game unfinished, that's the way it is.

Same way with life. Instead of a bowl of soup or a video game, you may have a
spouse or a career â€“ and no reason not to. But when that whistle blows, it's
back on the bus, and you'll have to leave them behind without a second thought.
But if you're old, stay right by the bus.
