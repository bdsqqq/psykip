Remember that you're acting in a play. It will go the way its author, not you,
wants â€“ short if it's going to be short, long if it's going to be long. If your
role is nothing more than a walk-on as a panhandler, try to perform it well.
Likewise if your part is that of a cripple, a politician or just John or Jane
Q. Public. What's up to you is playing your given part well. The casting is up
to another.
