Events don't disturb us; it's the attitudes we take toward events that disturb
us. For example, death isn't terrible, or it would have seemed that way to
Socrates; it's the idea that death is terrible that's terrible. So when we're
hindered or disturbed or saddened, let's not blame others but rather our own
opinions. It's the ignorant person who blames others for her or his troubles,
the person with a little training who blames only herself or himself, and the
well-instructed person who blames no one.
