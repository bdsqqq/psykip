It's like a banquet, with dishes going around. If something tasty stops in
front of you, take some if you want. If it hasn't reached you yet, don't grab
for it. If it misses you entirely, don't make a fuss.

Take the same attitude toward family, money and position. Partake of them as
they come to you and there's no blame. But if you scorn them when you could
easily have them, that's better â€“ even divine. It's for this behavior that
Diogenes and Heraclitus were rightly called godlike.
