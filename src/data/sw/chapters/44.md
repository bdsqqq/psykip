##  44

These do not follow logically: "I'm richer than you, therefore I'm better than
you," and "I'm more eloquent than you, therefore I'm better than you." Instead
the logical reasonings are: "I'm richer than you, therefore I have more money
than you," and "I'm more eloquent than you, therefore my style is better than
yours." But you, friend, are neither money nor speaking.
