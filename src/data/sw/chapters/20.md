Remember: It's not the person who calls you names or hits you who insults you â€“
it's your own conclusion that these things are insulting. Therefore, when
someone annoys you, it's your own attitude that's annoying you. So don't be
hypnotized by the seeming significance of the event; buy yourself some time,
and it'll be easier to get your attitudes back into line.
