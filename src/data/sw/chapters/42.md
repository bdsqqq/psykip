##  42

When anyone treats you badly, or attacks you verbally, it's because he thinks
it's the right thing to do. It's not possible for him to do what seems right to
you â€“ only what seems right to him. And if he's wrong, he's the only one who's
harmed. When someone thinks a true statement is false, the statement isn't
damaged, only the person who's mistaken about it. Using these principles,
you'll be mild with someone who criticizes you, and say, "That's the way he saw
it."
