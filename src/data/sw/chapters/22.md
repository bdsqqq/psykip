If you really want to pursue philosophy, be ready to take flak from people
who'll say "Here comes Mr. Philosopher again," and "Where'd he get the snotty
look?" As for you, skip the snotty look and stick to your job, just as though
God Himself had given it to you. Make these principles part of your life and
the people who jeered will eventually respect you. If you let them get to you
instead, they'll get to laugh at you twice.
