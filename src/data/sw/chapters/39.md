##  39

The body is the measure of material needs, just as the foot is the measure of
the shoe. Once you go beyond the measure, it's like falling off a cliff. With
the shoe, when it exceeds the needs of the foot, it can be made of the finest
leather, then fashionably colored, then garishly ornamented. Once the proper
measure has been passed, there are no limits.
