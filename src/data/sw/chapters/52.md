The first and most necessary part of philosophy is practical principles; for
example: don't lie. The second part is proofs, as of why we shouldn't lie. The
third, which validates the other two, is logical theory, answering such
questions as, how do we know that this is a valid proof? What is a logical
demonstration? What does it mean when we say something follows something else?
What is contradiction? What is truth? What is falsehood? The third part of
philosophy is necessary for the sake of the second, and the second for the sake
of the first. But the most necessary part, where we should linger, is the
first. Of course we do exactly the opposite. We spend our time on the third
part, becoming enthusiasts in that, and utterly neglect the first. So we lie
through our teeth, but we certainly can demonstrate why one shouldn't lie.
