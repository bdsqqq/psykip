##  46

Never call yourself wise, or talk much about your principles to civilians. Act
on your principles instead. At a party, for example, don't blather about how
people should behave; just behave as you should.

Socrates made no show of his wisdom. People came to him and asked to be
introduced to philosophers. He took them to philosophers, and didn't mind being
overlooked.

There's danger in regurgitating what you've only partly digested. And if
someone tells you that you don't know anything, and you aren't bothered, then
you've made a beginning at wisdom. Sheep don't throw up their grass to show the
shepherd how much they've eaten; they digest it internally, and then produce
milk and wool externally. So don't show off your thoughts to the ignorant, but
show them the actions your thoughts produce after they've been digested.
