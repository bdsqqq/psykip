At all times, we should keep these ideas ready:

Lead me, God and destiny,  
To the place you've planned for me,  
I'll follow cheerfully; if I didn't,  
Bad and unhappy, I must go there anyway.

Whoever surrenders to necessity,  
We call him wise and skilled with heaven.

Well, Crito, if the gods like it this way, then let it be.

Anytus and Melitus may kill me, but they can't hurt me.
