When an expert renders bad news, don't let the sense of doom foreseen run away
with you, but make the essential distinction and tell yourself: "This has
nothing to do with ME. It may be the worse for my measly body, or my measly
property or my measly family. But any news is good, if I decide it is, because
I can make good use of it, whatever it is."
