##  12

If you want to get better, give up thinking like this: "If I don't take care of
business, I won't make a living." "If I don't reprimand my employee, he'll be
useless." Because it's better to starve while free from grief and fear than to
live with abundance but be disturbed. Better your employee should be bad than
you should be unhappy.

Start small. There's minor breakage, or petty theft of paper clips? Say to
yourself: "This is the price of not being disturbed, the price of
tranquillity." There's no free lunch. So when you summon your subordinate,
remember that he may not come, and if he does he still may not do what you
want. But he's not so powerful that your peace of mind depends on him.
