When someone is proud because he can explain the writings of Chrysippus, say to
yourself, "If Chrysippus had written more clearly, this person would have
nothing to boast about."

What's my wish? To understand nature and live in harmony with it. I hear that
Chrysippus explains nature, so I want to understand him. I find his writings
obscure, so I seek someone to explain them.  So far, there's nothing I can take
pride in. When I find someone to explain Chrysippus to me, what counts is to
make use of his principles â€“ that's the thing I can take pride in. If I merely
admire the interpretation, I'm using my teacher as a literary critic rather
than as a philosopher, and we might as well be studying Homer instead of
Chrysippus.

When anyone asks me to explain Chrysippus, I'm embarrassed when I can't show my
own actions to be in keeping with his words.
