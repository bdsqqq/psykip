##  26

Learn nature's will from the ways in which we're alike. An example: Your
neighbor's car gets hit in a parking lot, and you're quick to say "Things like
that happen." When it's your own car's fender that gets crumpled, you should be
as quick to say the same thing.

Ditto bigger things. Someone else's spouse or parent or child dies, and we say
it's ordinary human mortality. When one's own spouse or parent or child dies,
one says "Oh, no! I can't stand it!" But we should remember how we react to the
news of someone else's similar misfortune.
