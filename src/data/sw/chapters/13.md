##  13

If you want to get better, let yourself seem foolish and uncaring about
externals. Don't try to seem knowledgeable. If anyone thinks you're important,
you're doing it wrong.

It's difficult to keep your will on track and simultaneously go after external
things. Take care of one and you'll surely neglect the other.
