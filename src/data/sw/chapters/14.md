If you want your family and friends to live forever, you're a fool, because
you're trying to control what you can't, and insisting that what's up to others
be within your will. Likewise, if you want your subordinate to perform
perfectly, you're a fool, because you're deciding that his attitudes must be
subject to yours. If you want to avoid disappointment, that you can do. Pay
attention to what's really up to you. Your master is whoever controls the
things you want, or want to avoid. If you want to be free, don't wish for
anything, or try to avoid anything, that others control; otherwise you're a
slave.
