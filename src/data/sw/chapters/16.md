##  16

When someone else is upset – problems with children, maybe, or a business
difficulty – watch out that you don't get upset too, by thinking that these
events themselves are really evil. Remember that what bothers your friend isn't
these events themselves – since someone else would be completely unmoved by
them – but the attitude she takes toward them, considering them so awful.
Commiserate with her, of course. Even sigh or groan, if that's what she's
doing. But don't let yourself sigh or groan inwardly.
