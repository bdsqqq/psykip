##  4

When you are going about any action, remind yourself what nature the action is.
If you are going to bathe, picture to yourself the things which usually happen
in the bath: some people splash the water, some push, some use abusive
language, and others steal. Thus you will more safely go about this action if
you say to yourself, "I will now go bathe, and keep my own mind in a state
conformable to nature." And in the same manner with regard to every other
action. For thus, if any hindrance arises in bathing, you will have it ready to
say, "It was not only to bathe that I desired, but to keep my mind in a state
conformable to nature; and I will not keep it if I am bothered at things that
happen.
