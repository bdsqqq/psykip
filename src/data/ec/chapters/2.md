##  2

Remember that following desire promises the attainment of that of which you are
desirous; and aversion promises the avoiding that to which you are averse.
However, he who fails to obtain the object of his desire is disappointed, and
he who incurs the object of his aversion wretched. If, then, you confine your
aversion to those objects only which are contrary to the natural use of your
faculties, which you have in your own control, you will never incur anything to
which you are averse. But if you are averse to sickness, or death, or poverty,
you will be wretched. Remove aversion, then, from all things that are not in
our control, and transfer it to things contrary to the nature of what is in our
control. But, for the present, totally suppress desire: for, if you desire any
of the things which are not in your own control, you must necessarily be
disappointed; and of those which are, and which it would be laudable to desire,
nothing is yet in your possession. Use only the appropriate actions of pursuit
and avoidance; and even these lightly, and with gentleness and reservation.
