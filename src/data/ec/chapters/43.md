##  43

Everything has two handles, the one by which it may be carried, the other by
which it cannot. If your brother acts unjustly, don't lay hold on the action by
the handle of his injustice, for by that it cannot be carried; but by the
opposite, that he is your brother, that he was brought up with you; and thus
you will lay hold on it, as it is to be carried.
