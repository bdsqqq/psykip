With regard to whatever objects give you delight, are useful, or are deeply
loved, remember to tell yourself of what general nature they are, beginning
from the most insignificant things. If, for example, you are fond of a specific
ceramic cup, remind yourself that it is only ceramic cups in general of which
you are fond. Then, if it breaks, you will not be disturbed. If you kiss your
child, or your wife, say that you only kiss things which are human, and thus
you will not be disturbed if either of them dies.
