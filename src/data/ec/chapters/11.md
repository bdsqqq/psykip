##  11

Never say of anything, "I have lost it"; but, "I have returned it." Is your
child dead? It is returned. Is your wife dead? She is returned. Is your estate
taken away? Well, and is not that likewise returned? "But he who took it away
is a bad man." What difference is it to you who the giver assigns to take it
back? While he gives it to you to possess, take care of it; but don't view it
as your own, just as travelers view a hotel.
