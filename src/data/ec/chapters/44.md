##  44

These reasonings are unconnected: "I am richer than you, therefore I am
better"; "I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better." The connection
is rather this: "I am richer than you, therefore my property is greater than
yours;" "I am more eloquent than you, therefore my style is better than yours."
But you, after all, are neither property nor style.
