##  52

The first and most necessary topic in philosophy is that of the use of moral
theorems, such as, "We ought not to lie;" the second is that of demonstrations,
such as, "What is the origin of our obligation not to lie;" the third gives
strength and articulation to the other two, such as, "What is the origin of
this is a demonstration." For what is demonstration? What is consequence? What
contradiction? What truth? What falsehood? The third topic, then, is necessary
on the account of the second, and the second on the account of the first.  But
the most necessary, and that whereon we ought to rest, is the first. But we act
just on the contrary. For we spend all our time on the third topic, and employ
all our diligence about that, and entirely neglect the first. Therefore, at the
same time that we lie, we are immediately prepared to show how it is
demonstrated that lying is not right.
