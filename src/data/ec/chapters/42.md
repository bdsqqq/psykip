##  42

When any person harms you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he acts or
speaks from a supposition of its being his duty. Now, it is not possible that
he should follow what appears right to you, but what appears so to himself.
Therefore, if he judges from a wrong appearance, he is the person hurt, since
he too is the person deceived. For if anyone should suppose a true proposition
to be false, the proposition is not hurt, but he who is deceived about it.
Setting out, then, from these principles, you will meekly bear a person who
reviles you, for you will say upon every occasion, "It seemed so to him."
