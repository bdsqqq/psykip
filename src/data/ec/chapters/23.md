If you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, so as to wish to please
anyone, be assured that you have ruined your scheme of life. Be contented,
then, in everything with being a philosopher; and, if you wish to be thought so
likewise by anyone, appear so to yourself, and it will suffice you.
