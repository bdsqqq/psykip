##  22

If you have an earnest desire of attaining to philosophy, prepare yourself from
the very first to be laughed at, to be sneered by the multitude, to hear them
say,." He is returned to us a philosopher all at once," and " Whence this
supercilious look?" Now, for your part, don't have a supercilious look indeed;
but keep steadily to those things which appear best to you as one appointed by
God to this station. For remember that, if you adhere to the same point, those
very persons who at first ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you are
conquered by them, you will incur a double ridicule.
