##  12

If you want to improve, reject such reasonings as these: "If I neglect my
affairs, I'll have no income; if I don't correct my servant, he will be bad."
For it is better to die with hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live
in affluence with perturbation; and it is better your servant should be bad,
than you unhappy.

Begin therefore from little things. Is a little oil spilt? A little wine
stolen? Say to yourself, "This is the price paid for apathy, for tranquillity,
and nothing is to be had for nothing." When you call your servant, it is
possible that he may not come; or, if he does, he may not do what you want. But
he is by no means of such importance that it should be in his power to give you
any disturbance.
