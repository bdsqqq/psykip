##  36

As the proposition, "Either it is day or it is night," is extremely proper for
a disjunctive argument, but quite improper in a conjunctive one, so, at a
feast, to choose the largest share is very suitable to the bodily appetite, but
utterly inconsistent with the social spirit of an entertainment. When you eat
with another, then, remember not only the value of those things which are set
before you to the body, but the value of that behavior which ought to be
observed towards the person who gives the entertainment.
