##  48

The condition and characteristic of a vulgar person, is, that he never expects
either benefit or hurt from himself, but from externals. The condition and
characteristic of a philosopher is, that he expects all hurt and benefit from
himself. The marks of a proficient are, that he censures no one, praises no
one, blames no one, accuses no one, says nothing concerning himself as being
anybody, or knowing anything: when he is, in any instance, hindered or
restrained, he accuses himself; and, if he is praised, he secretly laughs at
the person who praises him; and, if he is censured, he makes no defense. But he
goes about with the caution of sick or injured people, dreading to move
anything that is set right, before it is perfectly fixed. He suppresses all
desire in himself; he transfers his aversion to those things only which thwart
the proper use of our own faculty of choice; the exertion of his active powers
towards anything is very gentle; if he appears stupid or ignorant, he does not
care, and, in a word, he watches himself as an enemy, and one in ambush.
