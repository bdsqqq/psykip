Remember that you must behave in life as at a dinner party. Is anything brought
around to you? Put out your hand and take your share with moderation.  Does it
pass by you? Don't stop it. Is it not yet come? Don't stretch your desire
towards it, but wait till it reaches you. Do this with regard to children, to a
wife, to public posts, to riches, and you will eventually be a worthy partner
of the feasts of the gods. And if you don't even take the things which are set
before you, but are able even to reject them, then you will not only be a
partner at the feasts of the gods, but also of their empire. For, by doing
this, Diogenes, Heraclitus and others like them, deservedly became, and were
called, divine.
