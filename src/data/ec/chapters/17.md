Remember that you are an actor in a drama, of such a kind as the author pleases
to make it. If short, of a short one; if long, of a long one. If it is his
pleasure you should act a poor man, a cripple, a governor, or a private person,
see that you act it naturally. For this is your business, to act well the
character assigned you; to choose it is another's.
