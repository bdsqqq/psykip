Sickness is a hindrance to the body, but not to your ability to choose, unless
that is your choice. Lameness is a hindrance to the leg, but not to your
ability to choose. Say this to yourself with regard to everything that happens,
then you will see such obstacles as hindrances to something else, but not to
yourself.
