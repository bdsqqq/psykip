If you wish your children, and your wife, and your friends to live for ever,
you are stupid; for you wish to be in control of things which you cannot, you
wish for things that belong to others to be your own. So likewise, if you wish
your servant to be without fault, you are a fool; for you wish vice not to be
vice," but something else.  But, if you wish to have your desires
undisappointed, this is in your own control. Exercise, therefore, what is in
your control. He is the master of every other person who is able to confer or
remove whatever that person wishes either to have or to avoid. Whoever, then,
would be free, let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on
others else he must necessarily be a slave.
