Consider when, on a voyage, your ship is anchored; if you go on shore to get
water you may along the way amuse yourself with picking up a shellish, or an
onion. However, your thoughts and continual attention ought to be bent towards
the ship, waiting for the captain to call on board; you must then immediately
leave all these things, otherwise you will be thrown into the ship, bound neck
and feet like a sheep.  So it is with life. If, instead of an onion or a
shellfish, you are given a wife or child, that is fine. But if the captain
calls, you must run to the ship, leaving them, and regarding none of them. But
if you are old, never go far from the ship: lest, when you are called, you
should be unable to come in time.
