##  18

When a raven happens to croak unluckily, don't allow the appearance hurry you
away with it, but immediately make the distinction to yourself, and say, "None
of these things are foretold to me; but either to my paltry body, or property,
or reputation, or children, or wife. But to me all omens are lucky, if I will.
For whichever of these things happens, it is in my control to derive advantage
from it."
