##  13

If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid with regard
to external things. Don't wish to be thought to know anything; and even if you
appear to be somebody important to others, distrust yourself. For, it is
difficult to both keep your faculty of choice in a state conformable to nature,
and at the same time acquire external things. But while you are careful about
the one, you must of necessity neglect the other.
