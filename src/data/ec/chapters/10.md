With every accident, ask yourself what abilities you have for making a proper
use of it. If you see an attractive person, you will find that self-restraint
is the ability you have against your desire.  If you are in pain, you will find
fortitude. If you hear unpleasant language, you will find patience. And thus
habituated, the appearances of things will not hurry you away along with them.
