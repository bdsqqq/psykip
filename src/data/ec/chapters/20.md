Remember, that not he who gives ill language or a blow insults, but the
principle which represents these things as insulting. When, therefore, anyone
provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion which provokes you. Try,
therefore, in the first place, not to be hurried away with the appearance. For
if you once gain time and respite, you will more easily command yourself.
