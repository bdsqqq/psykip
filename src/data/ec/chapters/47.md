##  47

When you have brought yourself to supply the necessities of your body at a
small price, don't pique yourself upon it; nor, if you drink water, be saying
upon every occasion, "I drink water." But first consider how much more sparing
and patient of hardship the poor are than we. But if at any time you would
inure yourself by exercise to labor, and bearing hard trials, do it for your
own sake, and not for the world; don't grasp statues, but, when you are
violently thirsty, take a little cold water in your mouth, and spurt it out and
tell nobody.
