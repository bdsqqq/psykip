When you have recourse to divination, remember that you know not what the event
will be, and you come to learn it of the diviner; but of what nature it is you
know before you come, at least if you are a philosopher. For if it is among the
things not in our own control, it can by no means be either good or evil.
Don't, therefore, bring either desire or aversion with you to the diviner (else
you will approach him trembling), but first acquire a distinct knowledge that
every event is indifferent and nothing to you., of whatever sort it may be, for
it will be in your power to make a right use of it, and this no one can hinder;
then come with confidence to the gods, as your counselors, and afterwards, when
any counsel is given you, remember what counselors you have assumed, and whose
advice you will neglect if you disobey. Come to divination, as Socrates
prescribed, in cases of which the whole consideration relates to the event, and
in which no opportunities are afforded by reason, or any other art, to discover
the thing proposed to be learned. When, therefore, it is our duty to share the
danger of a friend or of our country, we ought not to consult the oracle
whether we will share it with them or not. For, though the diviner should
forewarn you that the victims are unfavorable, this means no more than that
either death or mutilation or exile is portended. But we have reason within us,
and it directs, even with these hazards, to the greater diviner, the Pythian
god, who cast out of the temple the person who gave no assistance to his friend
while another was murdering him.
