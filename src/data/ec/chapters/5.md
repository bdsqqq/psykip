Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they
form concerning things. Death, for instance, is not terrible, else it would
have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death
that it is terrible. When therefore we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved,
let us never attribute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own
principles. An uninstructed person will lay the fault of his own bad condition
upon others. Someone just starting instruction will lay the fault on himself.
Some who is perfectly instructed will place blame neither on others nor on
himself.
