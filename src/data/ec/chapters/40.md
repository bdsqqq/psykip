##  40

Women from fourteen years old are flattered with the title of "mistresses" by
the men. Therefore, perceiving that they are regarded only as qualified to give
the men pleasure, they begin to adorn themselves, and in that to place ill
their hopes. We should, therefore, fix our attention on making them sensible
that they are valued for the appearance of decent, modest and discreet
behavior.
