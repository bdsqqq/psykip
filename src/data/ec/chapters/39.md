The body is to everyone the measure of the possessions proper for it, just as
the foot is of the shoe. If, therefore, you stop at this, you will keep the
measure; but if you move beyond it, you must necessarily be carried forward, as
down a cliff; as in the case of a shoe, if you go beyond its fitness to the
foot, it comes first to be gilded, then purple, and then studded with jewels.
For to that which once exceeds a due measure, there is no bound.
