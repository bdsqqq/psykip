##  46

Never call yourself a philosopher, nor talk a great deal among the unlearned
about theorems, but act conformably to them. Thus, at an entertainment, don't
talk how persons ought to eat, but eat as you ought. For remember that in this
manner Socrates also universally avoided all ostentation. And when persons came
to him and desired to be recommended by him to philosophers, he took and-
recommended them, so well did he bear being overlooked. So that if ever any
talk should happen among the unlearned concerning philosophic theorems, be you,
for the most part, silent. For there is great danger in immediately throwing
out what you have not digested. And, if anyone tells you that you know nothing,
and you are not nettled at it, then you may be sure that you have begun your
business. For sheep don't throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much
they have eaten; but, inwardly digesting their food, they outwardly produce
wool and milk. Thus, therefore, do you likewise not show theorems to the
unlearned, but the actions produced by them after they have been digested.
