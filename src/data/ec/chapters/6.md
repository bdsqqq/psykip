Don't be prideful with any excellence that is not your own. If a horse should
be prideful and say, " I am handsome," it would be supportable. But when you
are prideful, and say, " I have a handsome horse," know that you are proud of
what is, in fact, only the good of the horse. What, then, is your own? Only
your reaction to the appearances of things. Thus, when you behave conformably
to nature in reaction to how things appear, you will be proud with reason; for
you will take pride in some good of your own.
