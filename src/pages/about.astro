          <p>
            The Enchiridion as an amazing book, an easy read filled with
            valuable insights. Unfortunatelly, even with multiple public domain
            translations, reading it can often be a bad experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between old and sometimes confusing terms, hard to find and even
            harder to download files and outdated websites; The barriers between
            an interested reader and this content were too big. So, why not make
            a website that solves these problems?

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">How?</h2>
        <ol class="flex flex-col gap-4 list-decimal">
          <li>
            We focused our efforts into good design. While the content is the
            reason we built this site, it's presentation is what solves the
            problems listed above. Both the User experience and interface were
            created to make this website the best way to read the Enchiridion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Even though some translations aren't the best for everyone, they
            might be the favorites of some folks, so instead of pushing for one
            or another, we made it easy to read the one that works for YOU.
          </li>
          <li>
            We understand that books are hard to share, with multiple file types
            that work for different devices with different applications a
            project like this can grow out of control fast. That's why we took a
            step back and choose to serve the content from each translation in a
            way that's easy to read and to share; nothing more, nothing less.
