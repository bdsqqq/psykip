          <p>
            The Enchiridion is a fascinating book, an easy read filled with
            valuable insights. Unfortunately—even with multiple public domain
            translations—reading it can often be a bad experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between old and sometimes confusing terms, hard to find and even
            harder to download files, and outdated websites, the barriers
            between an interested reader and this content are monumental. So,
            why not make a website that solves these problems?

          <li>
            We focused our efforts on design. While the content is the reason we
            built this site, its presentation is what solves the problems listed
            above. We made the best way to read the Enchiridion with our user
            experience and interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            Even though some translations aren't the best for everyone, they
            might be the favorites of some folks, so instead of pushing for one
            or another, we made it easy to read the one that works for YOU.
          </li>
          <li>
            We understand that books are hard to share, and with multiple file
            types that work for different devices with different applications, a
            project like this can grow out of control fast. That's why we took a
            step back and decided to serve the content from each translation in
            a way that's easy to read and share; nothing more, nothing less.
