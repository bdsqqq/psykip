When you've learned to take care of basic bodily needs with very little, don't
make a point of pride of it. If you drink only water, don't be constantly
telling everyone that you drink only water. (People who are really poor get by
on even less, and aren't always talking about it.) If you want to acquire
stamina and endurance, do your exercises in private, and don't make a boring
fetish of your ability to finish a marathon. If you are very thirsty, take a
mouthful of cold water, spit it out, and tell no one.
