Don't take pride in any merit that isn't your own. If a car got excited and
said, "I'm a great-looking car!" that might be acceptable, if only for its
novelty value. But if you get excited and say "I have a great-looking car,"
then you're getting puffed up over merit that belongs only to the car.

What's really yours, then? What you make of what happens in your life. And if
you use events well, you can be proud â€“ and you'll be proud of something good
that's all yours.
