If you think you've got to have something, and you don't get it, you're
miserable. If you think you've got to avoid something, and you wind up in the
middle of it anyway, you're miserable. That's what happens, sooner or later,
when you want something or want to avoid something. If the only things you try
to avoid are things that really are under your own control, then you'll never
have to take what you wanted to avoid. But if you try to avoid illness or
poverty or death, you're bound to be miserable, sooner or later. So stop trying
to avoid things you have no power to keep out of your life. Avoid instead the
undesirable attitudes that are within your power to shun.

For now, put all desires on the shelf. If you pursue what you can't control,
you'll be disappointed. And you don't yet understand the things you can control
that will be appropriate for you to pursue later.

As daily life requires simple selections and refusals of you, perform these
gently and moderately, not desperately; go easy.
