Everything has two handles, one you can bear it with and one you can't. If your
brother is unfair, and you try to grasp the situation by the handle of his
unfairness, you're using the handle that won't work. Grasp the situation by the
other handle, that he's your brother and the two of you were reared together,
and you can carry it well.
