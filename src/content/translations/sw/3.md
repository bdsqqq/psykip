With regard to everything that you enjoy, find useful, or love, keep their
nature in mind, starting with the smallest things. If you have a favorite
coffee cup, remember that it's a cup; then if it's broken, you can stand it.
When you hug your child or your spouse, remember that it's a mortal human being
you're hugging; then if that person dies, you can stand it.
