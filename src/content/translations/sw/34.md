If you have some possible pleasure in mind, don't get carried away with it. Let
it wait for you, while you think about how you'll feel when you're enjoying it,
and how you'll feel afterward, when you reproach yourself for it. Compare those
moments to the joy of having abstained and the congratulations you can then
properly give yourself. And if the prospective pleasure seems appropriate to
you, beware of the allure, the sweet promises it may be using on you, and think
again how much better an awareness of victory can be.
