When you see a person weeping in sorrow either when a child goes abroad or when
he is dead, or when the man has lost his property, take care that the
appearance do not hurry you away with it, as if he were suffering in external
things. But straightway make a distinction in your own mind, and be in
readiness to say, it is not that which has happened that afflicts this man, for
it does not afflict another, but it is the opinion about this thing which
afflicts the man. So far as words, then, do not be unwilling to show him
sympathy, and even if it happens so, to lament with him. But take care that you
do not lament internally also.
