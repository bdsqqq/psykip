Remember that in life you ought to behave as at a banquet. Suppose that
something is carried round and is opposite to you. Stretch out your hand and
take a portion with decency. Suppose that it passes by you. Do not detain it.
Suppose that it is not yet come to you. Do not send your desire forward to it,
but wait till it is opposite to you. Do so with respect to children, so with
respect to a wife, so with respect to magisterial offices, so with respect to
wealth, and you will be some time a worthy partner of the banquets of the gods.
But if you take none of the things which are set before you, and even despise
them, then you will be not only a fellow banqueter with the gods, but also a
partner with them in power. For by acting thus Diogenes and Heraclitus and
those like them were deÂ­servedly divine, and were so called.
