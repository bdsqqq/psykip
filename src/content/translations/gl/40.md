Women forthwith from the age of fourteen are called by the men mistresses
(dominae). Therefore, since they see that there is nothing else that they can
obtain, but only the power of lying with men, they begin to decorate
themselves, and to place all their hopes in this. It is worth our while, then,
to take care that they may know that they are valued (by men) for nothing else
than appearing (being) decent and modest and discreet.
