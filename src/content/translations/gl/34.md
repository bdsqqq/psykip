If you have received the impression of any pleasure, guard yourself against
being carried away by it; but let the thing wait for you, and allow yourself a
certain delay on your own part. Then think of both times, of the time when you
will enjoy the pleasure, and of the time after the enjoyment of the pleasure
when you will repent and will reproach yourself. And set against these things
how you will rejoice if you have abstained from the pleasure, and how you will
commend yourself. But if it seem to you seasonable to undertake (do) the thing,
take care that the charm of it, and the pleasure, and the attraction of it
shall not conquer you: but set on the other side the consideration how much
better it is to be conscious that you have gained this victory.
