When at a small cost you are supplied with everything for the body, do not be
proud of this; nor, if you drink water, say on every occasion, I drink water.
But consider first how much more frugal the poor are than we, and how much more
enduring of labor. And if you ever wish to exercise yourself in labor and
endurance, do it for yourself, and not for others: do not embrace statues. But
if you are ever very thirsty, take a draught of cold water, and spit it out,
and tell no man.
