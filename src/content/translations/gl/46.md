On no occasion call yourself a philosopher, and do not speak much among the
uninstructed about theorems (philosophical rules, precepts): but do that which
follows from them. For example, at a banquet do not say how a man ought to eat,
but eat as you ought to eat. For remember that in this way Socrates also
altogether avoided ostentation: persons used to come to him and ask to be
recommended by him to philosophers, and he used to take them to philosophers:
so easily did he submit to being overlooked. Accordingly, if any conversation
should arise among uninstructed persons about any theorem, generally be silent;
for there is great danger that you will immediately vomit up what you have not
digested. And when a man shall say to you, that you know nothing, and you are
not vexed, then be sure that you have begun the work (of philosophy). For even
sheep do not vomit up their grass and show to the shepherds how much they have
eaten; but when they have internally digested the pasture, they produce
externally wool and milk. Do you also show not your theorems to the
uninstructed, but show the acts which come from their digestion.
