When a raven has croaked inauspiciously, let not the apÂ­pearance hurry you away
with it; but straightaway make a distinction in your mind and say, None of
these things is signified to me, but either to my poor body, or to my small
property, or to my reputation, or to my children or to my wife: but to me all
significations are auspicious if I choose. For whatever of these things
results, it is in my power to derive benefit from it.
