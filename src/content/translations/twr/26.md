The will of Nature is to be learned from matters in which we ourselves are not
concerned.  For instance, when a boy breaks a cup, if it be another man’s, you
are ready enough to say, *Accidents will happen.* Know then, that  when your
own is broken it behoves you to be as though it were another man’s. And apply
this method even to greater things. When a neighbor’s wife or child dies, who
is there that will not say, *It is the lot of humanity.* But when your own wife
or child is dead, then it is straightway, *Alas! wretched that I am!* But you
ought to remember how you felt when you heard of another in the same plight.
