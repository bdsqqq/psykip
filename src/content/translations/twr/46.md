Never proclaim yourself a philosopher, nor talk much among the sensual about
the philosophic maxims; but do the things that follow from the maxims. For
example, do not discourse, at a feast, upon how one ought to eat, but eat as
you ought. For remember that even so Socrates everywhere banished ostentation,
so that men used to come to him desiring him to recommend them to teachers in
philosophy; and he brought them away and did so, so well did he bear being
overlooked.

And if, among the sensual, discourse should arise concerning some maxim, do you
for the most part keep silence; for there is great risk that you straightway
vomit up what you, have not digested. And when some one shall say to you
that you know nothing, and you are not offended, then know that the work is
begun. And as sheep do not bring their food to the shepherds, to show how
much they have eaten, but digesting inwardly their provender bear outwardly
wool and milk, even so do not you, for the most part, display your maxims
before the sensual, but rather the works which follow from them, when they
are digested.
