Our duties are universally fixed by the relations in which we find ourselves.
Is such a man your father? Then your duty is to bear dictation from him, to
take care of him, to yield to him in all things, to be patient with him when be
chides you, when he beats you. *But if he be a bad father?*  Is there then a
natural law that you should be related by kin to a good father? No, but simply
to a father.  And does your brother do you wrong? Then guard your own proper
position towards him, and do not consider what he is doing, but rather what you
may do in order that your will may be in accordance with Nature. For no other
can ever harm you if you do not choose it yourself, but you are harmed then,
when you imagine yourself to be so. Thus then you may discover your duties by
considering those of a neighbor, of a citizen, of a general, â€”if you will
accustom yourself to observe the relationships.
