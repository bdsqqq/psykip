‘Lead me, O Zeus, and thou Destiny, whithersoever ye have appointed me to go,
and may I follow fearlessly.

‘But if in an evil mind I be unwilling, still must I follow,’

‘That man is wise among us, and has understanding of things divine, who has
nobly agreed with Necessity.’

‘O Crito, if so it seem good to the Gods, so let it be; Anytus and Melitus are
able to kill me if they like, but to harm me, never,’
