If you wish to advance in philosophy you must dismiss such considerations as
*If I neglect my affairs, I shall not have wherewithal to support life. If I do
not correct my servant, he will be good-for-nothing,* For it is better to die
of hunger, having lived without grief and fear, than to live with a troubled
spirit amid abundance. And it is better to have a bad servant, than an
afflicted mind.

Make a beginning then with small matters. Is a little of your oil spilt? or a
little wine stolen? Then say to yourself *For so much, tranquility of mind is
bought, this is the price of peace.* For nothing can be gained without paying
for it, And when you call your servant, reflect that he may not hear you, or
that hearing, he may not do your bidding. For him indeed that is not well, but
for you it is altogether well that be have not the power to disturb your mind.
