Remember, at anything that shall befall you, to turn to yourself, and seek what
faculty you possess for making use of it.  If you see a beautiful person, you
will find a faculty for that, namely, Self- mastery. If toil is laid upon you,
you will find the faculty of Perseverance If you are reviled, you will find
Patience, And making this your wont, you will not be rapt-away by the
phantasms.
