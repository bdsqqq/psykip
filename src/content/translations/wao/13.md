If you wish to make progress, then be content to appear senseless and foolish
in externals, do not make it your wish to give the appearance of knowing
anything; and if some people think you to be an important personage, distrust
yourself. For be assured that it is no easy matter to keep your moral purpose
in a state of conformity with nature, and, at the same time, to keep externals;
but the man who devotes his attention to one of these two things must
inevitably neglect the other.
