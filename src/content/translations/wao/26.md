What the will of nature is may be learned from a consideration of the points in
which we do not differ from one another. For example, when some other person's
slave-boy breaks his drinking-cup, you are instantly ready to say, "That's one
of the things which happen." Rest assured, then, that when your own
drinking-cup gets broken, you ought to behave in the same way that you do when
the other man's cup is broken. Apply now the same principle to the matters of
greater importance. Some other person's child or wife has died; no one but
would say, "Such is the fate of man." Yet when a man's own child dies,
immediately the cry is, "Alas! Woe is me!" But we ought to remember how we feel
when we hear of the same misfortune befalling others.
