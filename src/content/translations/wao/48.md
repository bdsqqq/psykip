This is the position and character of a layman: He never looks for either help
or harm from himself, but only from externals. This is the position and
character of the philosopher: He looks for all his help or harm from himself.

Signs of one who is making progress are: He censures no one, praises no one,
blames no one, finds fault with no one, says nothing about himself as though he
were somebody or knew something. When he is hampered or prevented, he blames
himself. And if anyone compliments him, he smiles to himself at the person
complimenting; while if anyone censures him, he makes no defence. He goes about
like an invalid, being careful not to disturb, before it has grown firm, any
part which is getting well. He has put away from himself his every desire, and
has transferred his aversion to those things only, of what is under our
control, which are contrary to nature. He exercises no pronounced choice in
regard to anything. If he gives the appearance of being foolish or ignorant he
does not care. In a word, he keeps guard against himself as though he were his
own enemy lying in wait.
