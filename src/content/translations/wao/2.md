Remember that the promise of desire is the attainment of what you desire, that
of aversion is not to fall into what is avoided, and that he who fails in his
desire is unfortunate, while he who falls into what he would avoid experiences
misfortune. If, then, you avoid only what is unnatural among those things which
are under your control, you will fall into none of the things which you avoid;
but if you try to avoid disease, or death, or poverty, you will experience
misfortune. Withdraw, therefore, your aversion from all the matters that are
not under our control, and transfer it to what is unnatural among those which
are under our control. But for the time being remove utterly your desire; for
if you desire some one of the things that are not under our control you are
bound to be unfortunate; and, at the same time, not one of the things that are
under our control, which it would be excellent for you to desire, is within
your grasp. But employ only choice and refusal, and these too but lightly, and
with reservations, and without straining.
