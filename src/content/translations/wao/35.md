When you do a thing which you have made up your mind ought to be done, never
try not to be seen doing it, even though most people are likely to think
unfavourably about it. If, however, what you are doing is not right, avoid the
deed itself altogether; but if it is right, why fear those who are going to
rebuke you wrongly?
