Remember that you ought to behave in life as you would at a banquet. As
something is being passed around it comes to you; stretch out your hand and
take a portion of it politely. It passes on; do not detain it. Or it has not
come to you yet; do not project your desire to meet it, but wait until it comes
in front of you. So act toward children, so toward a wife, so toward office, so
toward wealth; and then some day you will be worthy of the banquets of the
gods. But if you do not take these things even when they are set before you,
but despise them, then you will not only share the banquet of the gods, but
share also their rule. For it was by so doing that Diogenes and Heracleitus,
and men like them, were deservedly divine and deservedly so called.
