Remember that you are an actor in a play, the character of which is determined
by the Playwright: if He wishes the play to be short, it is short; if long, it
is long; if He wishes you to play the part of a beggar, remember to act even
this role adroitly; and so if your role be that of a cripple, an official, or a
layman. For this is your business, to play admirably the role assigned you; but
the selection of that role is Another's.
