The following statements constitute a non sequitur: "I am richer than you are,
therefore I am superior to you"; or, "I am more eloquent than you are,
therefore I am superior to you." But the following conclusions are better: "I
am richer than you are, therefore my property is superior to yours"; or, "I am
more eloquent than you are, therefore my elocution is superior to yours." But
you are neither property nor elocution.
