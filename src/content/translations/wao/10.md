In the case of everything that befalls you, remember to turn to yourself and
see what faculty you have to deal with it. If you see a handsome lad or woman,
you will find continence the faculty to employ here; if hard labour is laid
upon you, you will find endurance; if reviling, you will find patience to bear
evil. And if you habituate yourself in this fashion, your external impressions
will not run away with you.
