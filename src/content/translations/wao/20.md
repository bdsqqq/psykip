Bear in mind that it is not the man who reviles or strikes you that insults
you, but it is your judgement that these men are insulting you. Therefore, when
someone irritates you, be assured that it is your own opinion which has
irritated you. And so make it your first endeavour not to be carried away by
the external impression; for if once you gain time and delay, you will more
easily become master of yourself.
