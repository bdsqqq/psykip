On no occasion call yourself a philosopher, and do not, for the most part, talk
among laymen about your philosophic principles, but do what follows from your
principles. For example, at a banquet do not say how people ought to eat, but
eat as a man ought. For remember how Socrates had so completely eliminated the
thought of ostentation, that people came to him when they wanted him to
introduce them to philosophers, and he used to bring them along. So well did he
submit to being overlooked. And if talk about some philosophic principle arises
among laymen, keep silence for the most part, for there is great danger that
you will spew up immediately what you have not digested. So when a man tells
you that you know nothing, and you, like Socrates, are not hurt, then rest
assured that you are making a beginning with the business you have undertaken.
For sheep, too, do not bring their fodder to the shepherds and show how much
they have eaten, but they digest their food within them, and on the outside
produce wool and milk. And so do you, therefore, make no display to the laymen
of your philosophical principles, but let them see the results which come from
these principles when digested.
