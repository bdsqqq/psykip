When you have adopted the simple life, do not pride yourself upon it, and if
you are a water-drinker do not say on every occasion, 'I am a water-drinker.'
And if you ever want to train laboriously, keep it to yourself and do not make
a show of it. Do not embrace statues. If you are very thirsty take a good
draught of cold water, and rinse you mouth and tell no one.
