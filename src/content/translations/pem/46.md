On no occasion call yourself a philosopher, nor talk at large of your
principles among the multitude, but act on your principles. For instance, at a
banquet do not say how one ought to eat, but eat as you ought.  Remember that
Socrates had so completely got rid of the thought of display that when men came
and wanted an introduction to philosophers he took them to be introduced; so
patient of neglect was he. And if a discussion arise among the multitude on
some principle, keep silent for the most part; for you are in great danger of
blurting out some undigested thought. And when some one says to you, 'You know
nothing', and you do not let it provoke you, then know that you are really on
the right road. For sheep do not bring grass to their shepherds and show them
how much they have eaten, but they digest their fodder and then produce it in
the form of wool and milk.  Do the same yourself; instead of displaying your
principles to the multitude, show them the results of the principles you have
digested.
