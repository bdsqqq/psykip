On every occasion we must have these thoughts at hand,

'Lead me, O Zeus, and lead me, Destiny,  
Whither ordained is by your decree.  
I'll follow, doubting not, or if with will  
Recreant I falter, I shall follow still.'

*[Cleanthes]*

'Who rightly with necessity complies  
In things divine we count him skilled and wise.'

*[Euripides, Fragment 965]*

'Well, Crito, if this be the godsâ€™ will, so be it.'

*[Plato, Crito, 43d]*

'Anytus and Meletus have power to put me to death, but not to harm me,'

*[Plato, Apology, 30c]*
