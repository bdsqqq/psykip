It is illogical to reason thus, 'I am richer than you, therefore I am superior
to you', 'I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am superior to you.' It is
more logical to reason, 'I am richer than you, therefore my property is
superior to yours', 'I am more eloquent than you, therefore my speech is
superior to yours.' You are something more than property or speech.
