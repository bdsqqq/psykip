Remember that the will to get promises attainment of what you will, and the
will to avoid promises escape from what you avoid; and he who fails to get what
he wills is unfortunate, and he who does not escape what he wills to avoid is
miserable. If then you try to avoid only what is unnatural in the region within
your control, you will escape from all that you avoid; but if you try to avoid
disease or death or poverty you will be miserable.

Therefore let your will to avoid have no concern with what is not in man's
power; direct it only to things in man's power that are contrary to nature. But
for the moment you must utterly remove the will to get; for if you will to get
something not in man's power you are bound to be unfortunate; while none of the
things in man's power that you could honourably will to get is yet within your
reach. Impulse to act and not to act, these are your concern; yet exercise them
gently and without strain, and provisionally.
