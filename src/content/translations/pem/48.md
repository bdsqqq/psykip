The ignorant man's position and character is this: he never looks to himself
for benefit or harm, but to the world outside him. The philosopher's position
and character is that he always look to himself for benefit and harm.

The signs of one who is making progress are: he blames none, praises none,
complains of none, accuses none, never speaks of himself as if he were
somebody, or as if he knew anything. And if any one compliments him he laughs
in himself at his compliment; and if one blames him, he makes no defence. He
goes about like a convalescent, careful not to disturb his constitution on its
road to recovery, until it has got firm hold. He has got rid of the will to
get, and his will to avoid is directed no longer to what is beyond our power
but only to what is in our power and contrary to nature. In all things he
exercises his will without strain. If men regard him as foolish or ignorant he
pays no heed. In one word, he keeps watch and guard on himself as his own
enemy, lying in wait for him.
