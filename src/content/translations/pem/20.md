Remember that foul words or blows in themselves are no outrage, but your
judgement that they are so. So when any one makes you angry, know that it is
your own thought that has angered you. Wherefore make it your first endeavour
not to let your impressions carry you away. For if once you gain time and
delay, you will find it easier to control yourself.
