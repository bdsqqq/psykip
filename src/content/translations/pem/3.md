When anything, from the meanest thing upwards, is attractive or serviceable or
an object of affection, remember always to say to yourself, 'What is its
nature?' If you are fond of a jug, say you are fond of a jug; then you will not
be disturbed if it be broken. If you kiss your child or your wife, say to
yourself that you are kissing a human being, for then if death strikes it you
will not be disturbed.
