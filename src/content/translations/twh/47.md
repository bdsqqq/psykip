When you have learned to nourish your body frugally, do not pique yourself upon
it; nor, if you drink water, be saying upon every occasion, " I drink water."
But first consider how much more frugal are the poor than we, and how much more
patient of hardship.  If at any time you would inure yourself by exercise to
labor and privation, for your own sake and not for the public, do not attempt
great feats; but when you are violently thirsty, just rinse your mouth with
water, and tell nobody.
