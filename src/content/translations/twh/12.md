If you would improve, lay aside such reasonings as these: "If I neglect my
affairs, I shall not have a maintenance; if I do not punish my servant, he will
be good for nothing." For it were better to die of hunger, exempt from grief
and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better that
your servant should be bad than you unhappy.

Begin therefore with little things. Is a little oil spilt or a little wine
stolen? Say to yourself, "This is the price paid for peace and tranquillity;
and nothing is to be had for nothing." And when you call your servant, consider
that it is possible he may not come at your call; or, if he does, that he may
not do what you wish. But it is not at all desirable for him, and very
undesirable for you, that it should be in his power to cause you any
disturbance.
