Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things.
Thus death is nothing terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates.
But the terror consists in our notion of death, that it is terrible. When,
therefore, we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never impute it to
others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own views. It is the action of an
uninstructed person to reproach others for his own misfortunes; of one entering
upon instruction, to reproach himself; and of one perfectly instructed, to
reproach neither others nor himself.
