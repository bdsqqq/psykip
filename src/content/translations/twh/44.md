These reasonings have no logical connection: "I am richer than you; therefore I
am your superior." "I am more eloquent than you; therefore I am your superior."
The true logical connection is rather this: "I am richer than you; therefore my
possessions must exceed yours."  " I am more eloquent than you; therefore my
style must surpass yours." But you, after all, consist neither in property nor
in style.
