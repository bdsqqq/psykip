Be not elated at any excellence not your own. If a horse should be elated, and
say, " I am handsome," it might be endurable. But when you are elated, and say,
" I have a handsome horse," know that you are elated only on the merit of the
horse. What then is your own? The use of the phenomena of existence.  So that
when you are in harmony with nature in this respect, you will be elated with
some reason; for you will be elated at some good of your own.
