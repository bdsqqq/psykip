With regard to whatever objects either delight the mind, or contribute to use,
or are tenderly beloved, remind yourself of what nature they are, beginning
with the merest trifles: if you have a favorite cup, that it is but a cup of
which you are fond, - for thus, if it is broken, you can bear it; if you
embrace your child, or your wife, that you embrace a mortal, - and thus, if
either of them dies, you can bear it.
