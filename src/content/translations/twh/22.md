If you have an earnest desire towards philosophy, prepare yourself from the
very first to have the multitude laugh and sneer, and say, "He is returned to
us a philosopher all at once;" and "Whence this supercilious look? " Now, for
your part, do not have a supercilious look indeed; but keep steadily to those
things which appear best to you, as one appointed by God to this particular
station. For remember that, if you are persistent, those very persons who at
first ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you are conquered by them,
you will incur a double ridicule.
