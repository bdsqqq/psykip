If you would improve, be content to be thought foolish and dull with regard to
externals. Do not desire to be thought to know anything; and though you should
appear to others to be somebody, distrust yourself. For be assured, it is not
easy at once to keep your will in harmony with nature, and to secure externals;
but while you are absorbed in the one, you must of necessity neglect the other.
