When any person does ill by you, or speaks ill of you, remember that he acts or
speaks from an impression that it is right for him to do so. Now, it is not
possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but only what appears
so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from false appearances, he is the person
hurt; since he too is the person deceived.  For if any one takes a true
proposition to be false, the proposition is not hurt, but only the man is
deceived. Setting out, then, from these principles, you will meekly bear with a
person who reviles you; for you will say upon every occasion, "It seemed so to
him."
