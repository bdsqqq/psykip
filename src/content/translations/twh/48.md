The condition and characteristic of a vulgar person is that he never looks for
either help or harm from himself, but only from externals. The condition and
characteristic of a philosopher is that he looks to himself for all help or
harm. The marks of a proficient are that he censures no one, praises no one,
blames no one, accuses no one; says nothing concerning himself as being
anybody, or knowing anything. When he is in any instance hindered or
restrained, he accuses himself; and if he is praised, he smiles to himself at
the person who praises him; and if he is censured, he makes no defence. But he
goes about with the caution of a convalescent, careful of interference with
anything that is doing well, but not yet quite secure. He restrains desire; he
transfers his aversion to those things only which thwart the proper use of our
own will; he employs his energies moderately in all directions; if he appears
stupid or ignorant, he does not care; and, in a word, he keeps watch over
himself as over an enemy and one in ambush.
