When anyone shows himself overly confident in ability to understand and
interpret the works of Chrysippus, say to yourself, " Unless Chrysippus had
written obscurely, this person would have had no subject for his vanity. But
what do I desire? To understand nature and follow her.  I ask, then, who
interprets her, and, finding Chrysippus does, I have recourse to him. I don't
understand his writings. I seek, therefore, one to interpret them." So far
there is nothing to value myself upon.  And when I find an interpreter, what
remains is to make use of his instructions. This alone is the valuable thing.
But, if I admire nothing but merely the interpretation, what do I become more
than a grammarian instead of a philosopher? Except, indeed, that instead of
Homer I interpret Chrysippus. When anyone, therefore, desires me to read
Chrysippus to him, I rather blush when I cannot show my actions agreeable and
consonant to his discourse.
