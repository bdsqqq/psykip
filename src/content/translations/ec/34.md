If you are struck by the appearance of any promised pleasure, guard yourself
against being hurried away by it; but let the affair wait your leisure, and
procure yourself some delay. Then bring to your mind both points of time: that
in which you will enjoy the pleasure, and that in which you will repent and
reproach yourself after you have enjoyed it; and set before you, in opposition
to these, how you will be glad and applaud yourself if you abstain. And even
though it should appear to you a seasonable gratification, take heed that its
enticing, and agreeable and attractive force may not subdue you; but set in
opposition to this how much better it is to be conscious of having gained so
great a victory.
