Does anyone bathe in a mighty little time? Don't say that he does it ill, but
in a mighty little time. Does anyone drink a great quantity of wine? Don't say
that he does ill, but that he drinks a great quantity.  For, unless you
perfectly understand the principle from which anyone acts, how should you know
if he acts ill? Thus you will not run the hazard of assenting to any
appearances but such as you fully comprehend.
