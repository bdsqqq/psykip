The will of nature may be learned from those things in which we don't
distinguish from each other. For example, when our neighbor's boy breaks a cup,
or the like, we are presently ready to say, "These things will happen." Be
assured, then, that when your own cup likewise is broken, you ought to be
affected just as when another's cup was broken. Apply this in like manner to
greater things. Is the child or wife of another dead? There is no one who would
not say, "This is a human accident." but if anyone's own child happens to die,
it is presently, "Alas I how wretched am I!" But it should be remembered how we
are affected in hearing the same thing concerning others.
