When you see anyone weeping in grief because his son has gone abroad, or is
dead, or because he has suffered in his affairs, be careful that the appearance
may not misdirect you. Instead, distinguish within your own mind, and be
prepared to say, "It's not the accident that distresses this person., because
it doesn't distress another person; it is the judgment which he makes about
it." As far as words go, however, don't reduce yourself to his level, and
certainly do not moan with him. Do not moan inwardly either.
