You may be unconquerable, if you enter into no combat in which it is not in
your own control to conquer. When, therefore, you see anyone eminent in honors,
or power, or in high esteem on any other account, take heed not to be hurried
away with the appearance, and to pronounce him happy; for, if the essence of
good consists in things in our own control, there will be no room for envy or
emulation. But, for your part, don't wish to be a general, or a senator, or a
consul, but to be free; and the only way to this is a contempt of things not in
our own control.
