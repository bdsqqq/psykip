Upon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready at hand:

"Conduct me, Jove, and you, O Destiny, Wherever your decrees have fixed my
station." *(Cleanthes)*

"I follow cheerfully; and, did I not, Wicked and wretched, I must follow still
Whoever yields properly to Fate, is deemed Wise among men, and knows the laws
of heaven." *(Euripides, Frag. 965)*

And this third:

"O Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be. Anytus and Melitus may
kill me indeed, but hurt me they cannot." *(Plato's Crito and Apology)*
